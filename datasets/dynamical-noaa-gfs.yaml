      <p>
      The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric
      Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction
      (NCEP) weather forecast model that generates data for dozens of
      atmospheric and land-soil variables, including temperatures, winds,
      precipitation, soil moisture, and atmospheric ozone concentration. The
      system couples four separate models (atmosphere, ocean model, land/soil
      model, and sea ice) that work together to depict weather conditions.
