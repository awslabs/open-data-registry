Name: Foundation Medicine Adult Cancer Clinical Dataset (FM-AD)
Description: |
  The Foundation Medicine Adult Cancer Clinical Dataset (FM-AD) is a study conducted by Foundation
  Medicine Inc (FMI). Genomic profiling data for approximately 18,000 adult patients with a diverse
  array of cancers was generated using FoundationeOne, FMI's commercially available, comprehensive
  genomic profiling assay. This dataset contains open Clinical and Biospecimen data.
