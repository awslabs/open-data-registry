Name: Cancer Genome Characterization Initiatives - Burkitt Lymphoma, HIV+ Cervical Cancer
Description: |
  The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiatives (CGCI) program supports cutting-edge genomics
  research of adult and pediatric cancers. CGCI investigators develop and apply advanced sequencing
  methods that examine genomes, exomes, and transcriptomes within various types of tumors. The
  program includes Burkitt Lymphoma Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP) project and HIV+ Tumor
  Molecular Characterization Project - Cervical Cancer (HTMCP-CC) project.
  
  The dataset contains open Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression
  Quantification, miRNA-Seq Isoform Expression Quantification, and miRNA Expression Quantification
  data.

  This dataset also contains controlled WGS/Targeted Sequencing/RNA-Seq/miRNA-Seq Aligned Reads,
  and RNA-Seq Splice Junction Quantification
