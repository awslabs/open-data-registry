Description: 'The Cancer Genome Characterization Initiatives (CGCI) program supports
  cutting-edge genomics research of adult and pediatric cancers. CGCI investigators
  develop and apply advanced sequencing methods that examine genomes, exomes, and
  transcriptomes within various types of tumors. The program includes Burkitt Lymphoma
  Genome Sequencing Project (BLGSP) project and HIV+ Tumor Molecular Characterization
  Project - Cervical Cancer (HTMCP-CC) project.

  The dataset contains open Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene
  Expression Quantification, miRNA-Seq Isoform Expression Quantification, and miRNA
  Expression Quantification data.

  This dataset also contains controlled WGS/Targeted Sequencing/RNA-Seq/miRNA-Seq
  Aligned Reads, and RNA-Seq Splice Junction Quantification
