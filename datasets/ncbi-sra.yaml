Description: The Sequence Read Archive (SRA), produced by the [National Center for
  Biotechnology Information (NCBI)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) at the [National
  Library of Medicine (NLM)](http://nlm.nih.gov/) at the [National Institutes of Health
  (NIH)](http://www.nih.gov/), stores raw DNA sequencing data and alignment information
  from high-throughput sequencing platforms. The SRA provides open access to these
  biological sequence data to support the research community's efforts to enhance
  reproducibility and make new discoveries by comparing data sets. Buckets in this
  registry contain public SRA data in the original (user submitted) format from select
  high value and newly-released studies as well as all public-access SRA formatted
  ETL+BQS data. Also included is all SRA metadata that can be leveraged for attribute-based
  data discovery.

Name: NIH NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) on AWS
Resources:
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-src-1
  Description: .bam, .cram, and .fastq files in a public S3 bucket. This is the first
    of two S3 buckets for source submissions from sequencing methodologies such as
    PacBio, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 10X Genomics.
  Region: us-east-1
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-src-2
  Description: .bam, .cram, and .fastq files in a public S3 bucket. This is the second
    of two S3 buckets for source submissions from sequencing methodologies such as
    PacBio, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, and 10X Genomics.
  Region: us-east-1
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-run-odp
  Description: .sra files in a public S3 bucket. This bucket contains all open access
    SRA submissions in the SRA Normalized format with full base quality scores. The
    SRA Toolkit will be required to convert these objects into FASTQ or SAM files.
    Note that this bucket is updated on a daily basis, however, there may be a one
    to two day lag between accessions being findable via the [SRA Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/advanced)
    and being accessible in this S3 bucket.
  Region: us-east-1
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::sra-ca-run-odp
  ControlledAccess: https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?page=login
  Description: .sra files in a controlled-access S3 bucket. This bucket contains controlled-access
    dbGaP submissions in the SRA Normalized format with full base quality scores.
    The SRA Toolkit will be required to convert these objects into FASTQ or SAM files.
    Note that this bucket is updated on a daily basis, however, there may be a one
    to two day lag between accessions being findable via the [SRA Search](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/advanced)
    and being accessible in this S3 bucket.
  Region: us-east-1
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::sra-pub-metadata-us-east-1/sra/metadata
  Description: Metadata files for the Sequence Read Archive, ready to load into [AWS
    Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/) and query with [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/).
  Region: us-east-1
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:867126678632:sra-pub-run-odp-objects
  Description: Update notifications for s3://sra-pub-run-odp. Users can subscribe
    to this SNS topic with [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) or [AWS Simple
    Queue Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/).
