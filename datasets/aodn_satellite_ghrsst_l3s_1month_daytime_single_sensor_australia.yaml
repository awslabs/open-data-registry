Name: Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - 1 month - Day
  time
Description: "This is a single-sensor multi-satellite SSTskin product for 1 month\
  \ of consecutive day-time periods, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments\
  \ on all available NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg\
  \ x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected map over the region 70\xB0E to 170\xB0\
  W, 20\xB0N to 70\xB0S.  Each grid cell contains the 1 month average of all the highest\
  \ available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.\
  \ The diagram at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates\
  \ where this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products.  Matchups\
  \ with buoy SST observations for the central date (adjusted to skin depths) indicate\
  \ typical 2014 biases of < 0.3 degC and standard deviations of 0.7 degC.  Refer\
  \ to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs\
  \ et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further information."
