Name: Sentinel-1 SLC dataset for Germany
Description: |
  The Sentinel1 Single Look Complex (SLC) unzipped dataset contains Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agencyâ€™s Sentinel-1 mission. Different from the zipped data provided by ESA, this dataset allows direct access to individual swaths required for a given study area, thus drastically minimizing the storage and downloading time requirements of a project. Since the data is stored on S3, users can utilize the boto3 library and s3 get_object method to read the entire content of the object into the memory for processing, without actually having to download it. The Sentinel-1 constellation consists of two satellites equipped with SAR sensors and a combined revisit time of six days. SAR imagery gets recorded regardless of weather conditions and daylight, which makes it ideally suited for monitoring land-use changes, surface deformations, land applications, oil spills, sea-ice, natural hazards, and for emergency response. In its current first stage, the dataset covers the entirety of Germany and is being updated continuously. As a next stage, the dataset will provide up-to-date coverage of the sentinel-1 SLC data over Europe.
  This dataset is retrieved from Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF) and consists of all Sentinel1-SLC imagery from the beginning (2014) to present.

UpdateFrequency: New Sentinel1-SLC IW data are updated regularly in an interval of 6 days, after they are available on the Alaska Satellite Facility endpoint.
