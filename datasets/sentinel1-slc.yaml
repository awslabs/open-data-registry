    Title: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar Tutorial
    URL: https://github.com/live-eo/sentinel1-slc/blob/main/docs/tutorial_InSAR.md
Description: "The Sentinel1 Single Look Complex (SLC) unzipped dataset contains Synthetic\
  \ Aperture Radar (SAR) data from the European Space Agency\u2019s Sentinel-1 mission.\
  \ Different from the zipped data provided by ESA, this dataset allows direct access\
  \ to individual swaths required for a given study area, thus drastically minimizing\
  \ the storage and downloading time requirements of a project. Since the data is\
  \ stored on S3, users can utilize the boto3 library and s3 get_object method to\
  \ read the entire content of the object into the memory for processing, without\
  \ actually having to download it. The Sentinel-1 constellation consists of two satellites\
  \ equipped with SAR sensors and a combined revisit time of six days. SAR imagery\
  \ gets recorded regardless of weather conditions and daylight, which makes it ideally\
  \ suited for monitoring land-use changes, surface deformations, land applications,\
  \ oil spills, sea-ice, natural hazards, and for emergency response. In its current\
  \ first stage, the dataset covers the entirety of Germany and is being updated continuously.\
  \ As a next stage, the dataset will provide up-to-date coverage of the sentinel-1\
  \ SLC data over Europe.\nThis dataset is retrieved from Alaska Satellite Facility\
  \ (ASF) and consists of all Sentinel1-SLC imagery from the beginning (2014) to present.\n"
