Name: NOAA National Bathymetric Source Data
Description: |
  The National Bathymetric Source (NBS) project creates and maintains high-resolution bathymetry composed of the best available data. This project enables the creation of next-generation nautical charts while also providing support for modeling, industry, science, regulation, and public curiosity. Primary sources of bathymetry include NOAA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hydrographic surveys and topographic bathymetric (topo-bathy) lidar (light detection and ranging) data.  Data submitted through the NOAA Office of Coast Surveyâ€™s external source data process are also included, with gaps in deep water filled through Global Multi-Resolution Topography, a merged model of bathymetry. Different vertical datums and file formats are made available to meet various uses. Bathymetric Attributed Grid (BAG) files or multilayer floating point GeoTIFFs with assocated Raster Attribute Tables (RAT) contain elevation, vertical uncertainty, with other quality metrics and source information. These files are arranged in a tiling, naming, and resolution scheme corresponding to the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) but are not for navigation due to the inclusion of additional non-navigation data and non-navigation vertical datums.  For navigational datasets please see the S-102 distribution portal. In the future "[nowCOAST](https://nowcoast.noaa.gov/)" will provide to the public web mapping services for the National Bathymetry.
