Name: NOAA National Bathymetric Source Data
Description: |
  The National Bathymetric Source (NBS) project creates and maintains 
  high-resolution bathymetry composed of the best available data. 
  This project enables the creation of next-generation nautical charts 
  while also providing support for modeling, industry, science, 
  regulation, and public curiosity. Primary sources of bathymetry include 
  NOAA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hydrographic surveys and 
  topographic bathymetric (topo-bathy) lidar (light detection and ranging) 
  data.  Data submitted through the NOAA Office of Coast Surveyâ€™s external 
  source data process are also included, with gaps in deep water filled 
  through Global Multi-Resolution Topography, a merged model of 
  bathymetry. Different vertical datums and file formats are made 
  available to meet various uses. The BlueTopo folder includes multilayer 
  floating point GeoTIFFs with associated Raster Attribute Tables (RAT) 
  containing elevation, vertical uncertainty, with other quality metrics 
  and source information. These files are arranged in a spatial tiling and
  resolution scheme corresponding to the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC)
  but are not for navigation due to the inclusion of additional 
  non-navigation data and non-navigation vertical datums. For 
  navigational datasets please see the S-102 distribution portal. 
  "[nowCOAST](https://nowcoast.noaa.gov/)" provides public access to BlueTopo
  through the nowCOAST viewer, web map tile services (WMTS), and links to
  individual datasets.
