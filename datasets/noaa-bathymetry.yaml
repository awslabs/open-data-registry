    \ (NBS) project creates and maintains \nhigh-resolution bathymetry composed of\
    \ the best available data. \nThis project enables the creation of next-generation\
    \ nautical charts \nwhile also providing support for modeling, industry, science,\
    \ \nregulation, and public curiosity. Primary sources of bathymetry include \n\
    NOAA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers hydrographic surveys and \ntopographic bathymetric\
    \ (topo-bathy) lidar (light detection and ranging) \ndata.  Data submitted through\
    \ the NOAA Office of Coast Survey\u2019s external \nsource data process are also\
    \ included, with gaps in deep water filled \nthrough Global Multi-Resolution Topography,\
    \ a merged model of \nbathymetry. Different vertical datums and file formats are\
    \ made \navailable to meet various uses. The BlueTopo folder includes multilayer\
    \ \nfloating point GeoTIFFs with associated Raster Attribute Tables (RAT) \ncontaining\
    \ elevation, vertical uncertainty, with other quality metrics \nand source information.\
    \ These files are arranged in a spatial tiling and\nresolution scheme corresponding\
    \ to the Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC)\nbut are not for navigation due to\
    \ the inclusion of additional \nnon-navigation data and non-navigation vertical\
    \ datums. For \nnavigational datasets please see the S-102 distribution portal.\
