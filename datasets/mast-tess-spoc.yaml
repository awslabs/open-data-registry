Name: TESS-SPOC
Description: |
  The data products for the TESS-SPOC FFI targets are the same as for the [TESS](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess)
  two-minute cadence targets: calibrated target pixel files, simple aperture photometry (SAP) flux time series, presearch data conditioning
  corrected (PDCSAP) flux time series, and cotrending basis vectors (CBV). Since TESS-SPOC relies on FFIs, data are sampled at the FFI cadence.
