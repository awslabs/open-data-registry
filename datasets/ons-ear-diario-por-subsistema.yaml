Name: DAILY EAR PER SUBSYSTEM
Description: Stored Energy Data (EAR) on a daily basis by Subsystem. This quantity represents the energy associated with the volume of water stored in the
 reservoirs that can be converted into generation in the power plant itself and in all plants downstream of the cascade. The magnitude of EAR considers the level verified in the reservoirs on the reference date. The maximum EAR magnitude is the storage capacity if all reservoirs were full.
