Name: Earth Observation Data Cubes for Brazil
Description: "Earth observation (EO) data cubes produced from analysis-ready data (ARD) of CBERS-4, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite images for the entire region of Brazil. Based on a hierarchical tiling system, the data cubes are regular in time, created by using a temporal compositing function to select the best pixel (free of cloud and cloud shadow) in each period (e.g. a month or 16 days). These EO data cubes are created by the Brazil Data Cube project developed by the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research (INPE)."
