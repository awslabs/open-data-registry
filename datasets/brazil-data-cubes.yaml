Name: Earth Observation Data Cubes for Brazil
Description: "Earth observation (EO) data cubes produced from analysis-ready data (ARD) images of CBERS-4, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satelites. Currently, each data cube contains images from a single satellite and sensor. There are two types of EO data cubes: identity and regular. Identity EO data cubes are ARD merged and cropped into a cube grid cell. Regular EO data cubes are created using temporal composition function over Identity data cubes to obtain
regularly-spaced in time (e.g. 16 days). These data cubes are mainly produced to support image time series analysis."
