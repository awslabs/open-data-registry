Name: Earth Observation Data Cubes for Brazil
Description: "Earth observation (EO) data cubes produced from analysis-ready data (ARD) of CBERS-4, Sentinel-2 A/B and Landsat-8 satellite images for Brazil. The datacubes are regular in time and use a hierarchical tiling system. Further details are described in [Ferreira et al. (2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/24/4033)."
