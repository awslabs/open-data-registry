    Title: 'Wizard of Tasks: A Novel Conversational Dataset for Solving Real-World
      Tasks in Conversational Settings'
    URL: https://aclanthology.org/events/coling-2022/
Description: Wizard of Tasks (WoT) is a dataset containing conversations for Conversational
  Task Assistants (CTAs). A CTA is a conversational agent whose goal is to help humans
  to perform real-world tasks. A CTA can help in exploring available tasks, answering
  task-specific questions and guiding users through step-by-step instructions. WoT
  contains about 550 conversations with ~18,000 utterances in two domains, i.e., Cooking
  and Home Improvement.
