Description: 'Africa''s long and dynamic coastline is subject to a wide range of pressures,
  including extreme weather and climate, sea level rise and human development. Understanding
  how the coastline responds to these pressures is crucial to managing this region,
  from social, environmental and economic perspectives.

  The Digital Earth Africa Coastlines (provisional) is a continental dataset that
  includes annual shorelines and rates of coastal change along the entire African
  coastline from 2000 to the present.

  The product combines satellite data from the Digital Earth Africa program with tidal
  modelling to map the typical location of the coastline at mean sea level for each
  year. The product enables trends of coastal erosion and growth to be examined annually
  at both a local and continental scale, and for patterns of coastal change to be
  mapped historically and updated regularly as data continues to be acquired. This
  allows current rates of coastal change to be compared with that observed in previous
  years or decades.

  The ability to map shoreline positions for each year provides valuable insights
  into whether changes to the coastline are the result of particular events or actions,
  or a process of more gradual change over time. This information can enable scientists,
  managers and policy makers to assess impacts from the range of drivers impacting
  the coastlines and potentially assist planning and forecasting for future scenarios.
