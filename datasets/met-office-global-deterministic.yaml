Name: Met Office Global Deterministic 10km on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: |
 THIS DATASET IS CHANGING
 Files uploaded from late January 2026 onward will contain changes including:
 - precision changes
 - new parameters
 - changes to existing parameters e.g. adding vertical levels and timesteps
 - the height_asl_on_pressure_levels parameter will be replaced by geopotential_height_on_pressure_levels
 
 Please check your systems are prepared for these changes.

 A numerical weather prediction forecast for the whole globe, with a resolution of approximately 0.09 degrees i.e. 10km (2,560 x 1,920 grid points). The data is available as NetCDF files. It's offered on a free, unsupported basis, so we don't recommend using it for any critical business purposes.

 The global deterministic model is a global configuration of the Unified Model, which is the Met Office’s flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model. The model’s initial state is kept close to the real atmosphere using hybrid 4D-Var data assimilation.

 The archive contains data from the past two years. The data is typically available approximately 3 to 6 hours after the model run time.

 The following timesteps are available for most parameters:
 - every hour from 0 to 54 hours
 - every 3 hours from 57 to 144 hours
 - every 6 hours from 150 to 168 hours
UpdateFrequency: |
 The model is run four times each day, with forecast reference times of 00:00, 06:00, 12:00 and 18:00 (UTC).

 The runs at 00:00 and 12:00 provide data for the next 168 hours. The runs at 06:00 and 18:00 provide data for the next 67 hours.

 The forecast reference time represents the nominal data time or start time of a model forecast run, rather than the time when the data is available.
