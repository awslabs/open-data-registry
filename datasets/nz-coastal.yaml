Name: New Zealand Coastal Elevation
Description: |
  The New Zealand Coastal Elevation dataset consists of New Zealand's publicly owned coastal digital elevation models, which are freely available to use under an open licence. The data consists of bare earth (DEM) data that traverses the coastal zone, including the seabed down to approximately 25m in depth. Data is provided as nationally consistent 1m resolution tiles derived from LiDAR surveys.

  All of the coastal elevation files are [Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) using LERC compression for the main grid and LERC compression with lower max_z_error for the overviews. These elevation files are accompanied by [STAC metadata](https://stacspec.org/). The coastal elevation data is organised by region and survey.
