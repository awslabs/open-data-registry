Name: Met Office Global Ensemble Prediction System (MOGREPS-G) on a 30-day rolling archive
Description: The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified
  Model, the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office
  runs several configurations of the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite.
  The global ensemble (MOGREPS-G) produces forecasts for the whole globe up to a week ahead. The projection
  used is the Equirectangular Latitude-Longitude and the grid resolution is 20km. The forecast is updated regularly
  with a 4-hour time delay and formatted via NetCDF.
  Please note this is a public beta and therefore a non-operational service.

Contact: servicedesk@metoffice.gov.uk. Service desk is only available Mon â€“ Fri, 09:00 until 17:00 UTC (-1 hour during BST).  As a non-operational service we aim to respond to any service support enquiries within 3-5 business days.
ManagedBy: "[Met Office](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/)"
UpdateFrequency: The MOGREPS-G model runs four times per day at 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC. The available time steps are provided every hour from 0 to 54 hours or from 0 to 132 hours and every 3 hours between 57 to 198 hours or from 135 to 198 hours.
