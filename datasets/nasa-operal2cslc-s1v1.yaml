Name: OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version
  1)
Description: "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis
  (OPERA) Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 validated product
  consists of Single Look Complex (SLC) images which contain both amplitude and phase
  information of the complex radar return. The amplitude is primarily determined by
  ground surface properties (e.g., terrain slope, surface roughness, and physical
  properties), and phase primarily represents the distance between the radar and ground
  targets corrected for the geometrical distance between the two based on the knowledge
  from Digital Elevation Model and platform’s position, i.e., the CSLC phase represents
  residual geometrical distance between the sensor and target, the atmospheric propagation
  delay and the target movements. The CSLC-S1 product is derived from Copernicus Sentinel-1A
  and Sentinel-1B Interferometric Wide (IW) SLC data.  \n\nThe CSLC images are precisely
  aligned or “coregistered” to a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection
  systems and posted at 5x10 m spacing in east and north direction, respectively.
  \ Each CSLC-S1 product corresponds to a single S1 burst and is distributed as a
  Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) file following the CF-1.8 convention containing
  both data raster layers (e.g., geocoded complex backscatter, low-resolution correction
  look-up tables) and product metadata. OPERA CSLC-S1 products are available over
  North America which includes the USA and U.S. Territories, Canada within 200 km
  of the U.S. border, and all mainland countries from the southern U.S. border down
  to and including Panama.  The OPERA CSLC-S1 product contains modified Copernicus
  Sentinel data (2016-2025).\n\nDue to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry
  layers vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are
  considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA CLSLC-S1
  product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times. The static
  layers are available in the associated OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from
  Sentinel-1 Static Layers validated product (Version 1).\nRead our doc on how to
