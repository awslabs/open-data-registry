Name: "NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) Marine Reanalysis: 1979-2019"
Description: |
  The NOAA UFS Marine Reanalysis is a global sea ice ocean coupled reanalysis product produced by the marine data assimilation team of the UFS Research-to-Operation (R2O) project. Underlying forecast and data assimilation systems are based on the UFS model prototype version-6 and the Next Generation Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (NG-GODAS) release of the Joint Effort for Data assimilation Integration (JEDI) Sea Ice Ocean Coupled Assimilation (SOCA). Covering the 40 year reanalysis time period from 1979 to 2019, the data atmosphere option of the UFS coupled global atmosphere ocean sea ice (DATM-MOM6-CICE6) model was applied with two atmospheric forcing data sets: CFSR from 1979 to 1999 and GEFS from 2000 to 2019. Assimilated observation data sets include extensive space-based marine observations and conventional direct measurements of in situ profile data sets.
  <br/><br/>
  This first UFS-marine interim reanalysis product is released to the broader weather and earth system modeling and analysis communities to obtain scientific feedback and applications for the development of the next generation operational numerical weather prediction system at the National Weather Service(NWS). The released file sets include two parts 1.) 1979 - 2019 UFS-DATM-MOM6-CICE6 model free runs and 2) 1979-2019 reanalysis cycle outputs (see descriptions embedded in each file set). Analyzed sea ice and ocean variables are ocean temperature, salinity, sea surface height, and sea ice concentration.

UpdateFrequency: "The UFS-DATM-MOM6-CICE6 model free run output contains continuous files from 1979-01-01 to
2019-08-30. Daily MOM6 and CICE6 diagnostic output files were produced for both model states
and observations assimilated in the reanalysis experiment. In the reanalysis runs, the MOM6 and
CICE6 models were initialized in a 24-hour analysis window centered at 12Z."
