Name: Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Optical Water Type (Moore et al 2009
  algorithm)
Description: 'The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight
  reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These measurements
  at discrete wavelengths represent the spectrum of light leaving the water surface,
  and the shape of the spectrum is characteristic of the water optical properties.


  Moore et al. (2009) applied a clustering technique to spectra to identify 8 sets
  of discrete optical water types. This product "owt_csiro" is produced using a CSIRO
  implementation of the Moore et al. algorithm, and testing shows that it closely
  reproduces the results of the original Moore et al implementation in the NASA SeaDAS
  package.  The CSIRO implementation was created because the implementation in SeaDAS
  has not been kept up to date, and to extend the product to the VIIRS sensor.'
