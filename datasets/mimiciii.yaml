Name: MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’)
Description: |
  MIMIC-III (‘Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care’) is a large, 
  single-center database comprising information relating to patients 
  admitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. 
  Data includes vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, 
  observations and notes charted by care providers, fluid balance, 
  procedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging reports, hospital length 
  of stay, survival data, and more. The database supports applications 
  including academic and industrial research, quality improvement initiatives, 
  and higher education coursework. The MIMIC-III dataset is freely-available. 
  Researchers seeking to use the database must formally request access. For details, see 
  [the getting started page](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/).  Once you 
  have a PhysioNet account, you must enable acccess to the MIMIC-III dataset from your 
  AWS account.  To do this, please [input your AWS account number](https://physionet.org/settings/cloud/), and 
  [request access to the MIMIC-III Clinical Database on AWS](https://physionet.org/projects/mimiciii/1.4/request_access/2).
