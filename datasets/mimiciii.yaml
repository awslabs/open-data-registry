Description: "MIMIC-III (\u2018Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care\u2019)\
  \ is a large, \nsingle-center database comprising information relating to patients\
  \ \nadmitted to critical care units at a large tertiary care hospital. \nData includes\
  \ vital signs, medications, laboratory measurements, \nobservations and notes charted\
  \ by care providers, fluid balance, \nprocedure codes, diagnostic codes, imaging\
  \ reports, hospital length \nof stay, survival data, and more. The database supports\
  \ applications \nincluding academic and industrial research, quality improvement\
  \ initiatives, \nand higher education coursework. The MIMIC-III dataset is freely-available.\
  \ \nResearchers seeking to use the database must formally request access. For details,\
  \ see \n[the getting started page](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/).\
  \  Once you \nhave a PhysioNet account, you must enable access to the MIMIC-III\
  \ dataset from your \nAWS account.  To do this, please [input your AWS account number](https://physionet.org/settings/cloud/),\
  \ and \n[request access to the MIMIC-III Clinical Database on AWS](https://physionet.org/projects/mimiciii/1.4/request_access/2).\n"
