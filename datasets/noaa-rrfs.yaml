Description: "NOTE** 3DRTMA data is being populated in the RRFS bucket under the prefix\
  \ 3DRTMA and diag. The content provided supports model development. These are not\
  \ yet operational NWS products and should not to be relied upon for operational\
  \ purposes. This web site is not subject to 24/7 support, and thus may be unavailable\
  \ during system outages.\n\n<br/><br/> \nThe Rapid Refresh Forecast System (RRFS)\
  \ is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) next generation\
  \ convection-allowing, rapidly-updated ensemble prediction system, currently scheduled\
  \ for operational implementation in 2024. The operational configuration will feature\
  \ a 3 km grid covering North America and include deterministic forecasts every hour\
  \ out to 18 hours, with deterministic and ensemble forecasts to 60 hours four times\
  \ per day at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC.The RRFS will provide guidance to support forecast\
  \ interests including, but not limited to, aviation, severe convective weather,\
  \ renewable energy, heavy precipitation, and winter weather on timescales where\
  \ rapidly-updated guidance is particularly useful.<br/><br/>\n\nThe RRFS is underpinned\
  \ by the [Unified Forecast System (UFS)](https://ufscommunity.org/), a community-based\
  \ Earth modeling initiative, and benefits from collaborative development efforts\
  \ across NOAA, academia, and research institutions.<br/><br/>\n\nThis bucket provides\
  \ access to real time, experimental RRFS prototype output as of October 2022. This\
  \ bucket also holds output from past experimental RRFS prototypes that were evaluated\
  \ as a part of NOAA testbed projects. The immediate section describes the data for\
  \ the real time system. The section that follows thereafter describes outputs from\
  \ three past NOAA Testbed experiments. <br/><br/>\n<hr/>\nReal time, experimental\
  \ RRFS Prototype output  <br/><br/>\n\nThe real-time RRFS prototype is experimental\
  \ and evolving. It is not under 24x7 monitoring and is not operational. Output may\
  \ be delayed or missing. Outputs will change. When significant changes to output\
  \ take place, this description will be updated.<br/><br/>\n\nWe currently provide\
  \ hourly deterministic forecasts at 3 km grid spacing over the CONUS out to 60 hours\
  \ at 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC, and out to 18 hours for other cycles. Future enhancements\
  \ will include a transition to running over the North American domain planned for\
  \ use by the operational RRFS. All forecasts are initialized from a hybrid 3DEnVar\
  \ data assimilation system with hourly updates. Output is organized by cycle date\
  \ and cycle hour.\n\nFor example, `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20230428/12/control` contains the\
  \ deterministic forecast initialized at 12 UTC on 28 April 2023. Users will find\
  \ two types of output in GRIB2 format. The first is:<br/><br/>\nrrfs.t00z.natlev.f018.conus_3km.grib2\
  \ <br/><br/>\n\nMeaning that this is the RRFS_A initialized at 00 UTC, covers the\
  \ CONUS domain, and is the native level post-processed gridded data at hour 18.\
  \  This output is on a Lambert Conic Conformal gird at 3 km grid spacing.<br/><br/>\n\
  \nThe second output file in grib2 format is:<br/><br/>\n\nrrfs.t00z.prslev.f018.conus_3km.grib2\
  \ <br/><br/>\n\nThe \u201Cprslev\u201D descriptor indicates that this post-processed\
  \ gridded data is output on pressure levels.\n\nBeginning on May 1st, 2023 we have\
  \ begun to regularly provide experimental single-physics and multi-physics RRFS\
  \ ensemble forecasts at 3 km grid spacing over the CONUS out to 60 hours at 00,\
  \ 06, 12, and 18 UTC. These experimental ensembles are provided as a part of NOAA's\
  \ ongoing Testbed experiments for the Spring and Summer of 2023 and are intended\
  \ to help inform the final configuration of RRFSv1's ensemble. Output is available\
  \ for 00, 06, 12, and 18 UTC cycles, and is organized by cycle date and cycle hour.\
  \ For example, `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20230428/12/single_physics/mem0001` contains the forecast\
  \ from member 1 of the single-physics ensemble, and `rrfs_a/rrfs_a.20230428/12/multi_physics/mem0004`\
  \ contains the forecast from member 4 of the multi-physics ensemble, both initialized\
  \ at 12 UTC on 28 April 2023.  Users will find two types of output in GRIB2 format,\
  \ which have the same file names as the deterministic RRFS forecast.\n\n<br/><br/>\n\
  <hr/>  \nPast output from NOAA Testbed Experiments  \n\n<br/><br/>\n\nThis bucket\
  \ also provides datasets from three of the 2021 NOAA Testbed Experiments. During\
  \ each of these experiments, a prototype version of RRFS under development was run.\
  \ The following is a high-level overview dates and RRFS configurations for each\
  \ of the Testbed Experiments.<br/><br/>\n\n2021 Hazardous Weather Testbed (HWT)\
  \ Spring Forecast Experiment (May 3 through June 4 2021) and 2021 Hydrometeorological\
  \ Testbed Annual Flash Flood and Intense Rainfall Experiment (FFaIR) (June 21 through\
  \ July 23 2021, excluding the week of July 4). A 9-member multi-physics ensemble\
  \ with stochastic perturbations run once per day at 3 km grid spacing covering North\
  \ America out to 60 hours. Initial conditions and lateral boundary conditions are\
  \ taken from the GFS and GEFS.<br/><br/>\n2021-2022 Hydrometeorological Testbed\
  \ Winter Weather Experiment (WWE) (mid November through mid-March). Select cases\
  \ only. Deterministic forecasts were run once per day at 00 UTC at 3 km grid spacing\
  \ covering the CONUS out to 60 hours.  A 36-member, 3 km ensemble Kalman filter\
  \ data assimilation approach is implemented through hourly cycling starting at 18\
  \ UTC on the previous day.<br/><br/>\n\nFor each cycle of the HWT and FFaIR experiments,\
  \ the dataset is organized by cycle day, time of day, and member. For example, `rrfs.20210504/00/mem01/`\
  \ contains the forecast from ensemble member 1 initialized at 00 UTC on 04 May 2021.\
  \ Users will find two types of output in GRIB2 format. The first is:<br/><br/>\n\
  rrfs.t00z.mem01.naf024.grib2<br/><br/>\nMeaning that this is RRFS ensemble member\
  \ 1 initialized at 00 UTC, covers the North American domain, and is the post-processed\
  \ gridded data at hour 24. This output is on a rotated latitude-longitude domain\
  \ at 3 km grid spacing. These are large files and users may wish to subset or re-project\
  \ the grid after downloading. We recommend using the [WGRIB2 application](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/wesley/wgrib2/)\
  \ for such purposes.<br/><br/>\nThe second output file in grib2 format is as follows:<br/><br/>\n\
  rrfs.t00z.mem01.testbed.conusf020.grib2<br/><br/>\nThese grids have been subset\
  \ from the much larger North American domain to a CONUS domain on a Lambert Conic\
  \ Conformal projection and also contain significantly fewer fields, resulting in\
  \ smaller files. <br/><br/>\nGraphics for select runs are also included in a plots/\
  \ directory under each experiment day for quick, yet simple visualization.<br/><br/>\n\
  \nFor each cycle of the WWE, the dataset is organized by cycle day and time of day.\
  \  For example, `rrfs.20220306/00/` contains data for the forecast initialized at\
  \ 00 UTC on 06 March 2022.  The initial conditions for the 36 ensemble members are\
  \ located in the `ens_ics/mem???` subdirectories.  Users will find two types of\
  \ output in GRIB2 format in the post subdirectories.  The first is:<br/><br/>\n\
  BGDAWP.GrbF12<br/><br/>\nMeaning that this is the forecast initialized at 00 UTC,\
  \ covers the CONUS domain, and is the pressure level post-processed gridded data\
  \ at forecast hour 18.  This output is on a Lambert Conic Conformal grid at 3 km\
  \ grid spacing.<br/><br/>\nThe second output file in grib2 format is as follows:<br/><br/>\n\
  testbed.conusf030.grib2<br/><br/>\nThese grids contain significantly fewer fields,\
  \ resulting in smaller files.<br/><br/>\n\nThis work is supported by the Unified\
  \ Forecast System Research to Operation (UFS R2O) Project which is jointly funded\
