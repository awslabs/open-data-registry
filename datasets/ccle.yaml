Name: Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE)
Description: |
  The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) project is an effort to conduct a detailed genetic
  characterization of a large panel of human cancer cell lines. The CCLE provides public access to
  genomic data, visualization and analysis for over 1100 cancer cell lines. This dataset contains
  RNA-Seq Aligned Reads, WXS Aligned Reads, and WGS Aligned Reads data.
