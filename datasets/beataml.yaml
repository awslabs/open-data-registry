Description: "Beat AML 1.0 is a collaborative research program involving 11 academic\
  \ medical centers who worked\ncollectively to better understand  drugs and drug\
  \ combinations that should be prioritized for\nfurther development within clinical\
  \ and/or molecular subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)\npatients. Beat AML 1.0\
  \ provides the largest-to-date dataset on primary acute myeloid leukemia\nsamples\
  \ offering genomic, clinical, and drug response.\n\nThis dataset contains open Clinical\
  \ Supplement and RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data.\n\nThis dataset also\
  \ contains controlled Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS) and RNA-Seq Aligned Reads, WXS\
  \ Annotated Somatic Mutation,\nWXS Raw Somatic Mutation, and RNA-Seq Splice Junction\
  \ Quantification  \n"
