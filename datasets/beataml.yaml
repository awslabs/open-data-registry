Name: Beat Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) 1.0
Description: |
  Beat AML 1.0 is a collaborative research program involving 11 academic medical centers who worked
  collectively to better understand  drugs and drug combinations that should be prioritized for
  further development within clinical and/or molecular subsets of acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
  patients. Beat AML 1.0 provides the largest-to-date dataset on primary acute myeloid leukemia
  samples offering genomic, clinical, and drug response.
  
  This dataset contains open Clinical Supplement and RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data.

  This dataset also contains controlled Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS) and RNA-Seq Aligned Reads, WXS Annotated Somatic Mutation,
  WXS Raw Somatic Mutation, and RNA-Seq Splice Junction Quantification
