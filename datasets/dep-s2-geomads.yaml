Name: Sentinel-2 Geometric Median and Absolute Deviations (GeoMAD) over the Pacific
Description: |
  The Geometric Median and Absolute Deviations (GeoMAD) product is
  a cloud-free annual mosaic that uses a more robust method of
  determining the median observation than a simple median. Along
  with the median observation, the GeoMAD produces three measures
  of variance, or absolute deviations, which helps to understand
  how the data over the time period changes. For example, some areas,
  such as desert, will change very little. Whereas crop land will change
  more. All ofthese values are useful in understand what is happening
  in the area covered by the GeoMAD.
