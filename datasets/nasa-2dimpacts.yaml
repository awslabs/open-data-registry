Name: Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD) IMPACTS V1
Description: The Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD) IMPACTS data were collected in support of the Investigation of Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) campaign. The IMPACTS field campaign addressed providing observations critical to understanding the mechanisms of snowband formation, organization, and evolution, examining how the microphysical characteristics and likely growth mechanisms of snow particles vary across snowbands, and improving snowfall remote sensing interpretation and modeling to significantly advance prediction capabilities.
