Name: Foldingathome COVID-19 Datasets
Description: >
  [Folding@home](http://foldingathome.org) is a massively distributed computing
  project that uses biomolecular simulations to investigate the [molecular origins of disease](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/)
  and accelerate the discovery of new therapies. Run by the
  [Folding@home Consortium](https://foldingathome.org/about/the-foldinghome-consortium/),
  a worldwide network of research laboratories focusing on a variety of different
  diseases, Folding@home seeks to address problems in human health on a scale
  that is infeasible by another other means, sharing the results of these large-scale
  studies with the research community through [peer-reviewed publications](https://foldingathome.org/papers-results/)
  and publicly shared datasets.
  During the [COVID-19 epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019),
  Folding@home focused its resources on understanding the vulnerabilities in
  [SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2),
  the virus that causes COVID-19 disease, and working closely with a number of
  experimental collaborators to accelerate progress toward effective therapies for
  treating COVID-19 and ending the pandemic. In the process, it created the world's first
  [exascale distributed computing resource](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.27.175430),
  enabling it to generate valuable scientific datasets of unprecedented size.
  More information about Folding@home's COVID-19 research activities at the
  [Folding@home COVID-19 page](https://foldingathome.org/diseases/infectious-diseases/covid-19/).
  In addition to working directly with experimental collaborators and rapidly sharing
  new research findings through preprint servers, Folding@home has joined other
  researchers in committing to [rapidly share all COVID-19 research data](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00319),
  and has joined forces with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) and the
  [Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI)](http://molssi.org) to share datasets of unprecedented side
  through the [AWS Open Data Registry](https://registry.opendata.aws/),
  indexing these massive datasets via the [MolSSI COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub](https://covid.molssi.org/).
  The complete index of all Folding@home datasets can be found [here](https://covid.molssi.org//org-contributions/#folding--home).
  This repository contains several major datasets from this effort and comprises
  the single largest collection of molecular simulation data ever released.
