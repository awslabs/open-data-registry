Name: Folding@home COVID-19 datasets
Description: Folding@home is a massively distributed computing project for running molecular dynamics simulations and has heavily focused itâ€™s resources to understand SARS-CoV-2 and develop therapeutics associated with COVID-19 disease. Efforts include simulation of the viral proteome to uncover functional dynamics and cryptic pockets, detail mechanisms of infection, understand antibody binding mechanisms, and identify new small molecule therapeutics. This repository contains several major datasets from this effort and comprises the single largest collection of molecular simulation.
