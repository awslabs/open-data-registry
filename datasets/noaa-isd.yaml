    Title: NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD) Example Notebook
    URL: https://github.com/awslabs/amazon-asdi/tree/main/examples/noaa-isd
Description: 'The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists

  of global hourly and synoptic observations

  compiled from numerous sources into a gzipped

  fixed width format. ISD was developed as a joint

  activity within Asheville''s Federal Climate

  Complex. The database includes over 35,000 stations

  worldwide, with some having data as far back

  as 1901, though the data show a substantial

  increase in volume in the 1940s and again in

  the early 1970s. Currently, there are over

  14,000 "active" stations updated daily in the

  database. The total uncompressed data volume is

  around 600 gigabytes; however, it continues to

  grow as more data are added. ISD includes

  numerous parameters such as wind speed and

  direction, wind gust, temperature, dew point,

  cloud data, sea level pressure, altimeter setting,

  station pressure, present weather, visibility,

  precipitation amounts for various time periods,

  snow depth, and various other elements as observed

  by each station.
