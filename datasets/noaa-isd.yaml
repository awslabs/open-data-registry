Name: NOAA Integrated Surface Database (ISD)
Description: |
  The Integrated Surface Database (ISD) consists
  of global hourly and synoptic observations
  compiled from numerous sources into a gzipped
  fixed width format. ISD was developed as a joint
  activity within Asheville's Federal Climate
  Complex. The database includes over 35,000 stations
  worldwide, with some having data as far back
  as 1901, though the data show a substantial
  increase in volume in the 1940s and again in
  the early 1970s. Currently, there are over
  14,000 "active" stations updated daily in the
  database. The total uncompressed data volume is
  around 600 gigabytes; however, it continues to
  grow as more data are added. ISD includes
  numerous parameters such as wind speed and
  direction, wind gust, temperature, dew point,
  cloud data, sea level pressure, altimeter setting,
  station pressure, present weather, visibility,
  precipitation amounts for various time periods,
  snow depth, and various other elements as observed
  by each station.
