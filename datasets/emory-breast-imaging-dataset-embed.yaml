Name: "EMory BrEast Imaging Dataset (EMBED)"
Description: |
  EMBED is a racially diverse mammography dataset containing 3.4M screening and diagnostic images from 110,000 patients collected from 2013-2020, with an
  equal representation of black and white women. The dataset is comprised of 2D, synthetic 2D (C-view), and 3D (digital breast tomosynthesis, i.e. DBT)
  images. It contains 60,000 annotated lesions linked to structured imaging descriptors and ground truth pathologic outcomes grouped into six severity
  classes. This release represents 20% of the total 2D and C-view dataset and is available for research use. DBT, US, and MRI exams will be added at a
  later date.</br></br>
