Name: xReverseLabs Domain Dataset
Description: >
  The xReverseLabs Domain Dataset provides open collections of domain names and
  their associated DNS records. It includes daily domain dumps, historical domain
  data, domain lists grouped by TLD/extension, and a Forward DNS (FDNS) dataset
  containing resolved domain-to-IP mappings with metadata. The dataset is designed
  to support cybersecurity, threat intelligence, and internet-scale research.
