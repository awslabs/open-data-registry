Description: 'The data are from observations with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA)
  which is a

  Square Kilometer Array (SKA) precursor in Western Australia.  This particular

  dataset is from the Epoch of Reionization project which is a key science driver

  of the SKA. Nearly 2PB of such observations have been recorded to date, this is

  a small subset of that which has been exported from the MWA data archive in

  Perth and made available to the public on AWS.  The data were taken to detect

  signatures of the first stars and galaxies forming and the effect of these early

  stars and galaxies on the evolution of the universe.
