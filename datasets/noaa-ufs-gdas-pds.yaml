Description: "The [Unified Forecast System (UFS)](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov/) is a\
  \ community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. It supports [multiple\
  \ applications](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov/applications/) with different forecast\
  \ durations and spatial domains. The [Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)](https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/GDASApp)\
  \ Application (App) is being used as the basis for uniting the [Global Workflow](http://NOAA-EMC/global-workflow)\
  \ and Global Forecast System (GFS) model with [Joint Effort for Data assimilation\
  \ Integration (JEDI)](https://jointcenterforsatellitedataassimilation-jedi-docs.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/)\
  \ capabilities.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Centers for Environmental Prediction\
  \ (NCEP) use GDAS to interpolate data from various observing systems and instruments\
  \ onto a three-dimensional grid. GDAS obtains its data through several observation\
  \ types: surface, balloon, wind profilers, aircraft reports, buoys, radar, and satellite.\
  \ This gridded output data is then used to initialize the GFS model. GDAS can be\
  \ used in standalone mode to run forward operators and variational data assimilation\
  \ (DA) for evaluation/development purposes. In the GDAS App, it supports GFS/GDAS\
  \ cycled forecasts in the Global Workflow. Currently, GDAS primarily uses GSI for\
  \ its data assimilation and cycling, but efforts are underway to replace GSI with\
  \ JEDI. \n"
