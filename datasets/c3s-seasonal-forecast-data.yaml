Name: Planette C3S Seasonal Forecast Data
Description: |
  The C3S seasonal forecast dataset provides global, daily, probabilistic forecasts of the Earth system, 
  enabling users to assess the likelihood of future climate states. These forecasts are particularly 
  valuable for studying slowly evolving climate patterns such as El Niño, La Niña, and the North Atlantic 
  Oscillation (NAO), which can be predicted with greater skill than the chaotic atmosphere. This dataset 
  is derived from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) archive and includes SEAS5 hindcasts 
  (1981-2016) and forecasts (2017-present) at 1°x1° global resolution. More models from the C3S archive will
  be updated as they are processed into cloud native format. The planette C3S archive stores this data in 
  cloud native format for easy access and analysis.
