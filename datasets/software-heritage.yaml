Description: "[Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) is the largest\n\
  existing public archive of software source code and accompanying\ndevelopment history.\
  \ The Software Heritage Graph Dataset is a fully\ndeduplicated Merkle DAG representation\
  \ of the Software Heritage archive.\n\nThe dataset links together file content identifiers,\
  \ source code\ndirectories, Version Control System (VCS) commits tracking evolution\
  \ over\ntime, up to the full states of VCS repositories as observed by Software\n\
  Heritage during periodic crawls. The dataset\u2019s contents come from major\ndevelopment\
  \ forges (including GitHub and GitLab), FOSS distributions (e.g.,\nDebian), and\
  \ language-specific package managers (e.g., PyPI). Crawling\ninformation is also\
  \ included, providing timestamps about when and where all\narchived source code\
  \ artifacts have been observed in the wild.\n"
