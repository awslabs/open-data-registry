Name: Software Heritage Graph Dataset
Description: |
    [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) is the largest
    existing public archive of software source code and accompanying
    development history. The Software Heritage Graph Dataset is a fully
    deduplicated Merkle DAG representation of the Software Heritage archive.

    The dataset links together file content identifiers, source code
    directories, Version Control System (VCS) commits tracking evolution over
    time, up to the full states of VCS repositories as observed by Software
    Heritage during periodic crawls. The dataset’s contents come from major
    development forges (including GitHub and GitLab), FOSS distributions (e.g.,
    Debian), and language-specific package managers (e.g., PyPI). Crawling
    information is also included, providing timestamps about when and where all
    archived source code artifacts have been observed in the wild.
    Author and committer information is anonymized.
