Description: |
  
      <p>
       The Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) is a global forecast model developed 
       by ECMWF. ENS is an ensemble configuration of IFS, containing 51 ensemble members.
       IFS consists of a numerical model of the Earth system, which includes
       an atmospheric model at its heart, coupled with models of other Earth system 
       components such as the ocean. The data assimilation system combines 
       the latest weather observations with a recent forecast to obtain the best 
       possible estimate of the current state of the Earth system.
