Name: MegaScenes
Description: The MegaScenes Dataset is an extensive collection of around 430k scenes, featuring over 100k structure-from-motion reconstructions and over 2 million registered images. MegaScenes includes a diverse array of scenes, such as minarets, building interiors, statues, bridges, towers, religious buildings, and natural landscapes. The images of these scenes are captured under varying conditions, including different times of day, various weather and illumination, and from different devices with distinct camera intrinsics.
