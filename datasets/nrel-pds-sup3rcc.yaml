    Title: Using the Sup3rCC Data
    URL: https://github.com/NREL/sup3r/blob/main/examples/sup3rcc/using_the_data.ipynb
Description: "Released to the public as part of the Department of Energy's Open Energy\
  \ Data Initiative, \nthese data represent a serially complete collection of hourly\
  \ 4km wind, solar, temperature, \nhumidity, and pressure fields for the Continental\
  \ United States under climate change scenarios.\n\nSup3rCC is downscaled Global\
  \ Climate Model (GCM) data. For example, the initial file set tagged\n\"sup3rcc_conus_mriesm20_ssp585_r1i1p1f1\"\
  \ is downscaled from MRI ESM 2.0 for climate change \nscenario SSP5 8.5 and variant\
  \ label r1i1p1f1. The downscaling process is performed using a \ngenerative machine\
  \ learning approach called sup3r: Super-Resolution for Renewable Energy \nResource\
  \ Data. The data includes both historical and future weather years, although the\
  \ \nhistorical years represent the historical average climate, not true historical\
  \ weather. \n\nThe Sup3rCC data is intended to help researchers study the impact\
  \ of climate change on energy \nsystems with high levels of wind and solar power\
  \ generation. Please note that all climate change \ndata is only a representation\
  \ of the *possible* future climate and contains significant \nuncertainty. Analysis\
  \ of multiple climate change scenarios and multiple climate models can help \nquantify\
  \ this uncertainty.\n"
