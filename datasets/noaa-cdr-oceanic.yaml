Name: NOAA Oceanic Climate Data Records
Description: |
  NOAA's Climate Data Records (CDRs) are robust, sustainable, and scientifically sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on how, where, and to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are changing. These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>
  Climate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAAâ€™s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>
  Oceanic Climate Data Records are measurements of oceans and seas both surface and subsurface as well as frozen state variables.
