Description: "NOAA's Climate Data Records (CDRs) are robust, sustainable, and scientifically\
  \ sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on how, where, and\
  \ to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are changing. These\
  \ datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with the longevity, consistency,\
  \ and continuity to assess and measure climate variability and change. NOAA CDRs\
  \ are vetted using standards established by the National Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\n\
  Climate Data Records are created by merging data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based\
  \ systems across decades. NOAA\u2019s Climate Data Records provides authoritative\
  \ and traceable long-term climate records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern\
  \ data analysis methods to historical global satellite data. This process can clarify\
  \ the underlying climate trends within the data and allows researchers and other\
  \ users to identify economic and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains\
  \ and extends CDRs by applying the same methods to present-day and future satellite\
  \ measurements.<br/><br/>\nOceanic Climate Data Records are measurements of oceans\
  \ and seas both surface and subsurface as well as frozen state variables.\n"
