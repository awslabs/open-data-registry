    ', Description: "NOAA's Climate Data Records (CDRs) are robust, sustainable, and\
    \ scientifically sound climate records that provide trustworthy information on\
    \ how, where, and to what extent the land, oceans, atmosphere and ice sheets are\
    \ changing. These datasets are thoroughly vetted time series measurements with\
    \ the longevity, consistency, and continuity to assess and measure climate variability\
    \ and change. NOAA CDRs are vetted using standards established by the National\
    \ Research Council (NRC).<br/><br/>\nClimate Data Records are created by merging\
    \ data from surface, atmosphere, and space-based systems across decades. NOAA\u2019\
    s Climate Data Records provides authoritative and traceable long-term climate\
    \ records. NOAA developed CDRs by applying modern data analysis methods to historical\
    \ global satellite data. This process can clarify the underlying climate trends\
    \ within the data and allows researchers and other users to identify economic\
    \ and scientific value in these records. NCEI maintains and extends CDRs by applying\
    \ the same methods to present-day and future satellite measurements.<br/><br/>\n\
    Oceanic Climate Data Records are measurements of oceans and seas both surface\
    \ and subsurface as well as frozen state variables.\n", Documentation: 'https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdr',
