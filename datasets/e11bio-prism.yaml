Name: E11bio PRISM
Description: |
  This dataset was generated using E11.bio's PRISM technology (Protein Reconstruction and Identification through Multiplexing),
  a platform that combines viral barcoding, expansion microscopy, and iterative immunolabeling for large-scale neuronal reconstruction.

  Neurons in the mouse hippocampal CA3 were transduced with a library of adeno-associated viruses (AAVs)
  encoding diverse “protein bits”—small epitope tags that act as combinatorial barcodes. 
  Tissue was then processed with an expansion microscopy protocol, physically enlarging the sample ~5×
  to achieve an effective voxel size of ~35 × 35 × 80 nm.
  Across multiple cycles of staining, imaging, and antibody stripping, the same expanded tissue was repeatedly labeled,
  enabling iterative immunostaining for dozens of molecular targets.

  The dataset includes:
  1) Light microscopy data of multiplexed brain tissue
  2) Segmentations of cell morphology and protein expression in the tissue
  3) Files for faster visualization of the data (e.g. precomputed format)
  4) Additional supporting files (e.g. model predictions, manual annotations etc.)
