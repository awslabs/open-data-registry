Name: OpenStreetMap Linear Referencing
Description: OSMLR a linear referencing system built on top of OpenStreetMap. OSM has great information about roads around the world and their interconnections, but it lacks the means to give a stable identifier to a stretch of roadway. OSMLR provides a stable set of numerical IDs for every 1 kilometer stretch of roadway around the world. In urban areas, OSMLR IDs are attached to each block of roadways between significant intersections.
