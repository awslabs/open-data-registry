Name: ArcticDEM
Description:  ArcticDEM - 2m GSD Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and mosaics from 2007 to the present. The ArticDEM project seeks to fill the need for high-resolution time-series elevation data in the Arctic. The time-dependent nature of the strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas. ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the Maxar constellation of optical imaging satellites.

UpdateFrequency: New DEM strips are added twice yearly.  Mosaic products are added as soon as they are available.
