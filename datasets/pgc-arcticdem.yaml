Description: ArcticDEM - 2m GSD Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and mosaics from 2007
  to the present. The ArticDEM project seeks to fill the need for high-resolution
  time-series elevation data in the Arctic. The time-dependent nature of the strip
  DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations
  of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles
  are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent
  and comprehensive product over large areas. ArcticDEM data is constructed from in-track
  and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the Maxar constellation
  of optical imaging satellites.
