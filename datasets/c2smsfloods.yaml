Description: This dataset consists of chips of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite
  data. Each Sentinel-1 chip contains a corresponding label for water and each Sentinel-2
  chip contains a corresponding label for water and clouds. Data is stored in folders
  by a unique event identifier as the folder name. Within each event folder there
  are subfolders for Sentinel-1 (s1) and Sentinel-2 (s2) data. Each chip is contained
  in its own sub-folder with the folder name being the source image id, followed by
  a unique chip identifier consisting of a hyphenated set of 5 numbers. All bands
  of the satellite data, as well as the labels, and overview images are contained
  within the chip folder.
