Name: TARGET-WT open data
Description: |
  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) is the collaborative
  effort of a large, diverse consortium of extramural and NCI investigators. The goal of the effort
  is to accelerate molecular discoveries that drive the initiation and progression of hard-to-treat
  childhood cancers and facilitate rapid translation of those findings into the clinic.

  Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common type of childhood kidney cancer and usually occurs before the
  age of six years. TARGET-WT projects provide comprehensive molecular characterization to determine
  the genetic changes that drive the initiation and progression of WT. The dataset contains open
  Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification, miRNA-Seq
  Isoform Expression Quantification, and miRNA Expression Quantification data from Genomic Data
  Commons (GDC), and open data from GDC Legacy Archive.
