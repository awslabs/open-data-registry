Name: NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) Re-forecast
Description: >
  NOAA has generated a multi-decadal reanalysis and reforecast data set to accompany the next-generation version of its ensemble prediction system, the Global Ensemble Forecast System, version 12 (GEFSv12). Accompanying the real-time forecasts are “reforecasts” of the weather, that is, retrospective forecasts spanning the period 2000-2019. These reforecasts are not as numerous as the real-time data; they were generated only once per day, from 00 UTC initial conditions, and only 5 members were provided, with the following exception. Once weekly, an 11-member reforecast was generated, and these extend in lead time to +35 days.
