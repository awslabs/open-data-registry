Description: "NOAA has generated a multi-decadal reanalysis and reforecast data set\
  \ to accompany the next-generation version of its ensemble prediction system, the\
  \ Global Ensemble Forecast System, version 12 (GEFSv12). Accompanying the real-time\
  \ forecasts are \u201Creforecasts\u201D of the weather, that is, retrospective forecasts\
  \ spanning the period 2000-2019. These reforecasts are not as numerous as the real-time\
  \ data; they were generated only once per day, from 00 UTC initial conditions, and\
  \ only 5 members were provided, with the following exception. Once weekly, an 11-member\
  \ reforecast was generated, and these extend in lead time to +35 days. \n"
