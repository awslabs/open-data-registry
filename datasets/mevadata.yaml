Description: 'The Multiview Extended Video with Activities (MEVA) dataset consists

  video data of human activity, both scripted and unscripted,

  collected with roughly 100 actors over several weeks.  The data was

  collected with 29 cameras with overlapping and non-overlapping

  fields of view. The current release consists of about 328 hours

  (516GB, 4259 clips) of video data, as well as 4.6 hours (26GB) of

  UAV data. Other data includes GPS tracks of actors, camera models,

  and a site map. We have also released annotations for roughly 184 hours of

  data. Further updates are planned.
