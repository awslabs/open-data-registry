Description: 'These data are red and color Reduced Data Record (RDR) observations
  collected and originally processed by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment
  (HiRISE) team. The mdata are processed from the Planetary Data System (PDS) stored
  RDRs, map projected, and converted to Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs (COGs) for efficient
  remote data access. These data are not photogrammetrically controlled and use a
  priori NAIF SPICE pointing. Therefore, these data will not co-register with controlled
  data products. Data are released using simple cylindrical (planetocentric positive
  East, center longitude 0, -180 - 180 longitude domain) or a pole centered polar
  stereographic projection. Data are projected to the appropriate IAU Well-known Text
  v2 (WKT2) represented projection.
