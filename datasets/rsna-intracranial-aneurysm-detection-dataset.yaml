Name:  RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection Dataset (RSNA-ICA)
Description: "The Radiological Society of North America Intracranial Aneurysm Detection (RSNA-ICA) dataset is a collection of over 4,000 CT brain scans annotated by a cohort of over 40 volunteer radiologists from RSNA and the American Society of Neuroradiology to show the presence and location of intracranial aneurysms. It also includes a set of about 200 imaging studies that are annotated with AI-generated segmentations highlighting abnormalities. The imaging data was provided by 18 institutions. Initially compiled in 2025 for the RSNA Intracranial Aneurysm Detection AI Challenge hosted on Kaggle competition platform (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-intracranial-aneurysm-detection), it represents the largest publicly available collection of its kind. Additional information on the dataset and how to make use of it is provided in a forthcoming Data Resource Publication listed below, as well as on the Kaggle competition website, which also provides access to models developed during the competition."
