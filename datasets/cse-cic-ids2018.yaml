Description: 'This dataset is the result of a collaborative project between the Communications
  Security Establishment (CSE) and The Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC)
  that use the notion of profiles to generate cybersecurity dataset in a systematic
  manner. It incluides a detailed description of intrusions along with abstract distribution
  models for applications, protocols, or lower level network entities. The dataset
  includes seven different attack scenarios, namely Brute-force, Heartbleed, Botnet,
  DoS, DDoS, Web attacks, and infiltration of the network from inside. The attacking
  infrastructure includes 50 machines and the victim organization has 5 departments
  includes 420 PCs and 30 servers. This dataset includes the network traffic and log
  files of each machine from the victim side, along with 80 network traffic features
  extracted from captured traffic using CICFlowMeter-V3.

  For more information on the creation of this dataset, see this paper by researchers
  at the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity (CIC) and the University of New Brunswick
  (UNB): [Toward Generating a New Intrusion Detection Dataset and Intrusion Traffic
  Characterization](http://www.scitepress.org/Papers/2018/66398/66398.pdf).
