Description: 'The State of Indiana Geographic Information Office and IOT Office of
  Technology manage a series of digital orthophotography dating back to 2005.  Every
  year''s worth of imagery is available as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files, original
  GeoTIFF, and other compressed deliverables such as ECW and MrSID.  Additionally,
  each imagery year is organized into a tile grid scheme covering the entire geography
  of Indiana.  All years of imagery are tiled from a 5,000 ft grid or sub tiles depending
  upon the resolution of the imagery.  The naming of the tiles reflects the lower
  left coordinate from the image.

UpdateFrequency: The State of Indiana has had a 4-year cycle collecting imagery.  The
  collections are designated by counties in three groups that cover Indiana, South
  to North.  Frequently these areas are referred to as Tiers in the other documentation.  For
  example, tier 1 (Central 3rd) extends from Harrison County in the South to Elkhart
  and St. Joshep County in the North, while Tier 2 consists of the counties to the
  eastern side of the State, and tier 3 are those counties to the western side of
  the State.
