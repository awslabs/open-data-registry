Name: High resolution, annual cropland and landcover maps for selected African countries
Description: >
  High resolution, annual cropland and landcover maps for selected African
  countries developed by [Clark University](https://clarku.edu)'s
  [Agricultural Impacts Research Group](https://agroimpacts.info/) using
  various machine learning approaches applied to Planet imagery, including field
  boundary and cultivated frequency maps, as well as multi-class land cover.
