Description: The v1 dataset includes AIA/HMI observations 2010-2018 and v2 includes
  AIA/HMI observations 2010-2020 in all 10 wavebands (94A, 131A, 171A, 193A, 211A,
  304A, 335A, 1600A, 1700A, 4500A), with 512x512 resolution and 6 minutes cadence;
  HMI vector magnetic field observations in Bx, By, and Bz components, with 512x512
  resolution and 12 minutes cadence; The EVE observations in 39 wavelengths from 2010-05-01
  to 2014-05-26, with 10 seconds cadence.
