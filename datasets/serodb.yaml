Name: SeroDB
Description: SeroDB is a database for fast voltammetry of neurochemicals (e.g., serotonin, dopamine, etc.). The database is composed of in vitro (e.g., flow cell) and in vivo (e.g., brain) training and testing data obtained using fast voltammetry, broadly defined. The training data can be used to train statistical inference/machine learning models to predict neurochemical concentration dynamics on the test data. The types of waveforms and electrodes used, the neurochemicals and animal models under study, and any other experimental parameters (e.g., pharmacologic, electrical, optogenetic stimulation) should be noted in the experimental file. Any voltammetry data for neurochemical analysis with application to the brain is welcome to be contributed.
