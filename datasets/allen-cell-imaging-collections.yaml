Name: Allen Cell Imaging Collections
Description: |
  This bucket contains multiple datasets (as Quilt packages) created by the
  Allen Institute for Cell Science (AICS). The imaging data in this bucket contains
  either of the following:

  1) field of view images from glass plates
  2) cell membrane, DNA, and structure segmentations
  3) cell membrane, DNA and structure contours
  4) machine learning imaging predictions of the previously listed modalities.

  In addition, many of the datasets include CSVs that contain feature sets
  related to that data.
