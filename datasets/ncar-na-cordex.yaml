Name: NA-CORDEX - North American component of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment
Description: >
  The NA-CORDEX dataset contains regional climate change scenario data and guidance for North America, for use in impacts, decision-making, and climate science.
  The NA-CORDEX data archive contains output from regional climate models (RCMs) run over a domain covering most of North America using boundary conditions from global climate model (GCM) simulations in the CMIP5 archive. These simulations run from 1950–2100 with a spatial resolution of 0.22°/25km or 0.44°/50km. 
  This AWS S3 version of the data includes selected variables converted to Zarr format from the original NetCDF. Only daily data are currently available; all daily data were mapped to the Gregorian calendar. Sub-daily data may be added later. Both raw and bias-corrected data are available.
  Further details about this version of the dataset are available at the documentation link below.
