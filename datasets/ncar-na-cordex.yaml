Description: "The NA-CORDEX dataset contains regional climate change scenario data\
  \ and guidance for North America, for use in impacts, decision-making, and climate\
  \ science. The NA-CORDEX data archive contains output from regional climate models\
  \ (RCMs) run over a domain covering most of North America using boundary conditions\
  \ from global climate model (GCM) simulations in the CMIP5 archive. These simulations\
  \ run from 1950\u20132100 with a spatial resolution of 0.22\xB0/25km or 0.44\xB0\
  /50km.  This AWS S3 version of the data includes selected variables converted to\
  \ Zarr format from the original NetCDF. Only daily data are currently available;\
  \ all daily data were mapped to the Gregorian calendar. Sub-daily data may be added\
  \ later. Both raw and bias-corrected data are available. Further details about this\
  \ version of the dataset are available at the documentation link below.\n"
