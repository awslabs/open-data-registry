Name: Rain over Africa
Description: The Rain over Africa (RoA) dataset consists of spaceborn estimates of precipitation of Rain over Africa using only geostationary imagery and obtained through a convolutional and quantile regression neural network. The dataset also contains some uncertainty estimates.
