Description: "The OpenCell project is a proteome-scale effort to measure the localization\
  \ and interactions of human proteins\nusing high-throughput genome engineering to\
  \ endogenously tag thousands of proteins in the human proteome.\nThis dataset consists\
  \ of the raw confocal fluorescence microscopy images for all tagged cell lines in\
  \ the OpenCell library. \nThese images can be interpreted both individually, to\
  \ determine the localization of particular proteins of interest,\nand in aggregate,\
  \ by training machine learning models to classify or quantify subcellular localization\
  \ patterns. \n"
