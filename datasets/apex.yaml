Name: APEX-CONNECTS
Description: >
  The BRAIN Initiative Connectivity Across Scales (CONNECTS) program is working to create detailed maps of brain 
  wiring across different species and scales, using advanced imaging technologies. 
  APEX supports this effort by serving as a central hub that brings together and coordinates data and tools 
  from research focused on brain connectivity in humans and animals. Together, these efforts aim to improve our 
  understanding of how the brain is structured and functions.
