    URL: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/pmcaws/
Description: "PubMed Central\xAE (PMC) is a free full-text archive of biomedical and\
  \ life sciences journal article at the U.S. National Institutes of Health's National\
  \ Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM). The PubMed Central (PMC) Article Datasets include\
  \ full-text articles archived in PMC and made available under license terms that\
  \ allow for text mining and other types of secondary analysis and reuse. The articles\
  \ are organized on AWS based on general license type:<br/><br/>\nThe PMC Open Access\
  \ (OA) Subset, which includes all articles in PMC with a machine-readable Creative\
  \ Commons license<br/><br/> The Author Manuscript Dataset, which includes all articles\
  \ collected under a funder policy in PMC and made available in machine-readable\
  \ formats for text mining<br/><br/>\nThese datasets collectively span more than\
  \ half of PMC\u2019s total collection of full-text articles. PMC enables access\
  \ to these datasets to expand the impact of open access and publicly-funded research;\
  \ enable greater machine learning across the spectrum of scientific research; reach\
  \ new audiences; and open new doors for discovery. The bucket in this registry contains\
  \ individual articles in NISO Z39.96-2015 JATS XML format as well as in plain text\
  \ as extracted from the XML. The bucket is updated daily with new and updated articles.\
  \ Also included are file lists that include metadata for articles in each dataset."
