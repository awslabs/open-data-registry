Name: Surya Bench
Description: |
    This dataset provides machine learning (ML)-ready solar data curated from NASAâ€™s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), covering observations from May 13, 2010, to July 31, 2024. It includes Level-1.5 processed data from:
    - Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA):
    - Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI):
    The dataset is designed to facilitate large-scale ML applications in heliophysics, such as solar activity forecasting, unsupervised representation learning, and scientific foundation model development.
