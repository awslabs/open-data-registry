Name: PyEnvs and CallArgs
Description: |
  PyEnvs is a collection of 2814 permissively licensed Python packages along with their isolated development environments. Paired with a program analyzer (e.g. Jedi Language Server), it supports querying for project-related information. 
  
  CallArgs is a dataset built on top of PyEnvs for function call argument completion. It provides function definition, implementation, and usage information for each function call instance.
