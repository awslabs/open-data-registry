    Title: Using Open Bio Ref Data with Galaxy and Bioconductor
    URL: https://github.com/openbiorefdata/tutorials/
Description: 'This dataset provides genomic reference data and software packages for
  use with [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://bioconductor.org/)
  applications. The reference data is available for hundreds of reference genomes
  and has been formatted for use with a variety of tools. The available configuration
  files make this data easily incorporable with a local Galaxy server without additional
  data preparation. Additionally, Bioconductor''s AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub
  data are provided for use via R packages through which the data can be downloaded
  and installed into any R environment.

  Description: 'The data is organized as versioned objects for reference data, and
    data packages for use with the R programming language. The reference data is primarily
    intended for use with the Galaxy application, and has been formatted for easy
    configuration. In the future, additional formats may be provided. The packages
    as well as the AnnotationHub and ExperimentHub data are intended for use with
    R / Bioconductor.
