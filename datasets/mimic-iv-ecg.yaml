Name: 'MIMIC-IV-ECG: Diagnostic Electrocardiogram Matched Subset'
Description: The MIMIC-IV-ECG module contains approximately 800,000 diagnostic electrocardiograms
  across nearly 160,000 unique patients. These diagnostic ECGs use 12 leads and are
  10 seconds in length. They are sampled at 500 Hz. This subset contains all of the
  ECGs for patients who appear in the MIMIC-IV Clinical Database. When a cardiologist
  report is available for a given ECG, we provide the needed information to link the
  waveform to the report. The patients in MIMIC-IV-ECG have been matched against the
  MIMIC-IV Clinical Database, making it possible to link to information across the
  MIMIC-IV modules.
