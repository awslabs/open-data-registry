Description: 'The 1950 Census population schedules were created by the Bureau of the
  Census in an attempt to enumerate every person living in the United States on April
  1, 1950, although some persons were missed. The 1950 census population schedules
  were digitized by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and released
  publicly on April 1, 2022.

  The 1950 Census enumeration district maps contain maps of counties, cities, and
  other minor civil divisions that show enumeration districts, census tracts, and
  related boundaries and numbers used for each census. The coverage is nation wide
  and includes territorial areas.

  The 1950 Census enumeration district descriptions contain written descriptions of
  census districts, subdivisions, and enumeration districts.
