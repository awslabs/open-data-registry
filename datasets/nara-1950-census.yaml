Name: 1950 Census Population Schedules, Enumeration District Maps, and Enumeration District Descriptions

Description: |
  The 1950 Census population schedules were created by the Bureau of the Census in an attempt to enumerate every person living in the United States on April 1, 1950, although some persons were missed. The 1950 census population schedules were digitized by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and released publicly on April 1, 2022.
  The 1950 Census enumeration district maps contain maps of counties, cities, and other minor civil divisions that show enumeration districts, census tracts, and related boundaries and numbers used for each census. The coverage is nation wide and includes territorial areas.
  The 1950 Census enumeration district descriptions contain written descriptions of census districts, subdivisions, and enumeration districts.
