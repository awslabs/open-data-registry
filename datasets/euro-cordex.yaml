Name: EURO-CORDEX - European component of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment
Description: |
  The EURO-CORDEX dataset contains regional climate model data for Europe, for use in impacts, decision-making, and climate science. 
  Currently, the bucket contains monthly datasets of 2m air temperature downscaled from CMIP5 global model datasets using different
  regional climate models.
