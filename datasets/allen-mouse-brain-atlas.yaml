Name: Allen Mouse Brain Atlas
Description: |
  The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is a collection of 650,000 images of mouse brain sections. Sections were taken from 56-day-old adult male mice and stained using in situ hybridization targeting one of 20,000 messenger RNA genes. Data was initially published in Lein et al. (2007), Nature 445:168-176 (doi:10.1038/nature05453).
