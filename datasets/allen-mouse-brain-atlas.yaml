Description: 'The Allen Mouse Brain Atlas is a genome-scale collection of cellular
  resolution gene expression profiles using in situ hybridization (ISH). Highly methodical
  data production methods and comprehensive anatomical coverage via dense, uniformly
  spaced sampling facilitate data consistency and comparability across >20,000 genes.
  The use of an inbred mouse strain with minimal animal-to-animal variance allows
  one to treat the brain essentially as a complex but highly reproducible three-dimensional
  tissue array. The entire Allen Mouse Brain Atlas dataset and associated tools are
  available through an unrestricted web-based viewing application (http://mouse.brain-map.org).
  The collection of > 650,000 images have been made available in this Open Data bucket
  to enable efficient access and analysis of the this dataset.
