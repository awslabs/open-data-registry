Name: "NOAA S-104 Water Level Data"
Description: |
  S-104 is a data and metadata encoding specification that is part of the [S-100 Universal Hydrographic Data Model](https://iho.int/en/s-100-universal-hydrographic-data-model), an international standard for hydrographic data. This collection of data contains water level forecast guidance from [NOAA's Global Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System 2-D (STOFS-2D-Global)](https://polar.ncep.noaa.gov/estofs/), an operational hydrodynamic nowcast and forecast modeling system for global water level conditions. These datasets are encoded as HDF-5 files conforming to the S-104 specification, and are geospatially subset into individual tiles conforming to the NOAA/OCS Nautical Product Tiling Scheme, with filenames indicating the corresponding NOAA Electronic Navigational Chart (ENC) Cell Identifier. A set of prototype S-104 tiles has been created for the Charleston, SC area for a select model run cycle. Each individual S-104 (HDF-5) file contains all forecast projections from a single model run for that geographic area. A single S-104 file will contain multiple gridded arrays each containing a forecast valid at a distinct time in the future, out to the forecast horizon of STOFS-2D-Global, which is 180 hours or 7.5 days. The water level forecast guidance includes the combined effects of storm surge (sub-tidal) and tides (astronomical tide predictions).
