Name: Ocean Radar - Rottnest shelf site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: "The Rottnest Shelf (ROT) HF ocean radar system covers an area which\
  \ includes Rottnest Island and the Perth Canyon to the north-west.  The Perth Canyon\
  \ has the highest marine biodiversity in the region with whale and fish aggregations,\
  \ and high primary and secondary productions which are controlled by the physical\
  \ oceanographic processes.  \n\nCombined with the dynamics of the Perth Canyon is\
  \ the dominant Leeuwin Current which produces a wake on the leeward side of Rottnest\
  \ Island.   This is a topographically induced up-welling and associated primary\
  \ and secondary productivity.  The region is influenced by Swan River outflow, submarine\
  \ groundwater discharges , and waste-water outfalls.  \n\nThe ROT HF ocean radar\
  \ is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located at Fremantle\
  \ (32.031 S, 115.746 E) and Guilderton (31.342 S, 115.489 E).  These radars operate\
  \ at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of\
  \ 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.  Data\
  \ are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height can\
  \ be calculated.  \n\nThe ROT area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed\
  \ ocean with the Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its north\
  \ side.  Together, the ROT and TURQ systems provide continuous monitoring of the\
  \ shelf from Fremantle to Jurien Bay."
