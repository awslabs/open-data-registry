Name: Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) GK-2A Satellite Data
Description:   |
  The Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) is the new generation geostationary meteorological satellite (located in 128.2Â°E) of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA). The main mission of the GK2A is to observe the atmospheric phenomena over the Asia-Pacific region. The Advance Meteorological Imager (AMI) on GK2A scan the Earth full disk every 10 minutes and the Korean Peninsula area every 2 minutes with a high spatial resolution of 4 visible channels and 12 infrared channels. In addition, the AMI has an ability of flexible target area scanning useful for monitoring severe weather events such as typhoon and volcanic eruption and so on. And for space weather mission, the Korea Space wEather Monitor (KSEM) on the GK2A observes the space environment with the particle detector, magnetometer and charging monitor. For questions regarding GK2A imagery specifications, visit the GK2A site at https://nmsc.kma.go.kr/enhome/html/base/cmm/selectPage.do?page=satellite.gk2a.intro.
