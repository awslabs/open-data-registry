    Title: GK2A Full Fact Sheet
    URL: https://nmsc.kma.go.kr/enhome/html/base/cmm/selectPage.do?page=satellite.gk2a.fact
Description: "The Geo-KOMPSAT-2A (GK2A) is the new generation geostationary meteorological\
  \ satellite (located in 128.2\xB0E) of the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA).\
  \ The main mission of the GK2A is to observe the atmospheric phenomena over the\
  \ Asia-Pacific region. The Advance Meteorological Imager (AMI) on GK2A scan the\
  \ Earth full disk every 10 minutes and the Korean Peninsula area every 2 minutes\
  \ with a high spatial resolution of 4 visible channels and 12 infrared channels.\
  \ In addition, the AMI has an ability of flexible target area scanning useful for\
  \ monitoring severe weather events such as typhoon and volcanic eruption and so\
  \ on. And for space weather mission, the Korea Space wEather Monitor (KSEM) on the\
  \ GK2A observes the space environment with the particle detector, magnetometer and\
  \ charging monitor. For questions regarding GK2A imagery specifications, visit the\
  \ GK2A site at https://nmsc.kma.go.kr/enhome/html/base/cmm/selectPage.do?page=satellite.gk2a.intro.\
