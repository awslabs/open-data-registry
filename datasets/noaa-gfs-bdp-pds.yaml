Name: NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS)
Description: |
  The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced
  by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of
  atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset,
  from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and
  atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS
  at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid
  points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather
  out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles
  (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two
  weeks.

  The NOAA Global Forecast Systems (GFS) Warm Start Initial Conditions are 
  produced by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction Center (NCEP) 
  to run operational deterministic medium-range numerical weather predictions.   
  The GFS is built with the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3) 
  and the Grid-Point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data assimilation system.  
  Please visit the links below in the Documentation section to find more details 
  about the model and the data assimilation systems.   The current operational 
  GFS is run at 64 layers in the vertical extending from the surface to the upper
  stratosphere and on six cubic-sphere tiles at  the C768 or 13-km horizontal
  resolution.  A new version of the GFS that has 127 layers extending to the
  mesopause will be implemented for operation on February 3, 2021.   These initial
  conditions are made available four times per day for running forecasts at the
  00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles, respectively.   For each cycle, the dataset
  contains the first guess of the atmosphere states found in the directory
  ./gdas.yyyymmdd/hh-6/RESTART, which are  6-hour GDAS forecast from the last
  cycle,  and atmospheric analysis increments and surface analysis for the current
  cycle  found in the directory ./gfs.yyyymmdd/hh, which are produced by the data
  assimilation systems.
