    \ Global Forecast System to v16.3.0 - Effective November 29, 2022 See notification\
    \ [HERE](https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/scn22-104_gfs.v16.3.0.pdf)\n\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced\n\
    by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of\natmospheric\
    \ and land-soil variables are available through this dataset,\nfrom temperatures,\
    \ winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and\natmospheric ozone concentration.\
    \ The entire globe is covered by the GFS\nat a base horizontal resolution of 18\
    \ miles (28 kilometers) between grid\npoints, which is used by the operational\
    \ forecasters who predict weather\nout to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution\
    \ drops to 44 miles\n(70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between\
    \ one week and two\nweeks.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NOAA Global Forecast Systems (GFS)\
    \ Warm Start Initial Conditions are \nproduced by the National Centers for Environmental\
    \ Prediction Center (NCEP) \nto run operational deterministic medium-range numerical\
    \ weather predictions.   \nThe GFS is built with the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere\
    \ Dynamical Core (FV3) \nand the Grid-Point Statistical Interpolation (GSI) data\
    \ assimilation system.  \nPlease visit the links below in the Documentation section\
    \ to find more details \nabout the model and the data assimilation systems.  \
    \ The current operational \nGFS is run at 64 layers in the vertical extending\
    \ from the surface to the upper\nstratosphere and on six cubic-sphere tiles at\
    \  the C768 or 13-km horizontal\nresolution.  A new version of the GFS that has\
    \ 127 layers extending to the\nmesopause will be implemented for operation on\
    \ February 3, 2021.   These initial\nconditions are made available four times\
    \ per day for running forecasts at the\n00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles, respectively.\
    \   For each cycle, the dataset\ncontains the first guess of the atmosphere states\
    \ found in the directory\n./gdas.yyyymmdd/hh-6/RESTART, which are  6-hour GDAS\
    \ forecast from the last\ncycle,  and atmospheric analysis increments and surface\
    \ analysis for the current\ncycle  found in the directory ./gfs.yyyymmdd/hh, which\
    \ are produced by the data\nassimilation systems. \n", Documentation: 'https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/gfs.php',
