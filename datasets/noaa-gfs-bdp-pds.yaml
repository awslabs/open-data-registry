Name: NOAA Global Forecast System (GFS)
Description: |
  The Global Forecast System (GFS) is a weather forecast model produced
  by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). Dozens of
  atmospheric and land-soil variables are available through this dataset,
  from temperatures, winds, and precipitation to soil moisture and
  atmospheric ozone concentration. The entire globe is covered by the GFS
  at a base horizontal resolution of 18 miles (28 kilometers) between grid
  points, which is used by the operational forecasters who predict weather
  out to 16 days in the future. Horizontal resolution drops to 44 miles
  (70 kilometers) between grid point for forecasts between one week and two
  weeks.
