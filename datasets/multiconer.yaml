Name: MultiCoNER Dataset
Description: MultiCoNER is a large multilingual dataset (11 languages) for Named Entity Recognition. It is designed to represent some of the contemporary challenges in NER, including low-context scenarios (short and uncased text), syntactically complex entities such as movie titles, and long-tail entity distributions.
