Name: ProteinGym
Description: | 
  ProteinGym is a benchmark suite for assessing the performance of protein fitness prediction and design models. It comprises a large curated collection of 200+ high-throughput experimental assays (~3M mutated sequences), as well as clinical annotations from experts about the pathogenicity of mutants in over 3k human genes.
