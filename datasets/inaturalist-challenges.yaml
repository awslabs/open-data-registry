Name: iNaturalist Challenge Datasets
Description: |
  The iNaturalist challenges have been held in conjunction
  with the FGVC workshop at CVPR. These datasets aim to
  benchmark the performance and progress of computer vision
  classification models on tasks related to species
  identification in images. The images are sourced from the
  [iNaturalist project](https://www.inaturalist.org/).
