Name: NOAA Historical Maps and Charts
Description: Historical Charts are not for Navigation. The collection primarily consists of historic charts and maps produced by NOAA's Coast Survey and its predecessors, especially the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey and the U.S. Lake Survey (previously under the Department of War). The collection also includes bathymetric maps, land sketches, Civil War battle maps, aeronautical charting from the 1930s to the 1950s, and other drawings and photographs.
