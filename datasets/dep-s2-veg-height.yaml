Name: Digital Earth Pacific Vegeation Height
Description: |
  The Vegetation Height product provides an annual map of mean above-ground vegetation height (metres) at 10 m resolution across Pacific Island countries and territories. It captures structural height for a broad range of plant functional types, including herbaceous cover (grasses), low woody vegetation (shrubs), and arboreal canopies (forests), as well as crops, to support monitoring, planning, and climate applications. What “average height per pixel” means is that each 10 × 10 m pixel may contain a mix of ground, understory and canopy. The reported value is the expected mean height of all vegetative elements within that pixel, not the maximum canopy top height. Pixels with little will be near 0 m. No vegetation is shown as “no data”.
