Description: In order to support NOAA's homeland security and emergency response requirements,
  the National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division (NGS/RSD) has the capability
  to acquire and rapidly disseminate a variety of spatially-referenced datasets to
  federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as the general public. Remote
  sensing technologies used for these projects have included lidar, high-resolution
  digital cameras, a film-based RC-30 aerial camera system, and hyperspectral imagers.
  Examples of rapid response initiatives include acquiring high resolution images
  with the Emerge/Applanix Digital Sensor System (DSS).
