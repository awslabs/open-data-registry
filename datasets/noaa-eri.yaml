  Description: 'In order to support NOAA''s homeland security and emergency response
    requirements, the National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division (NGS/RSD) has
    the capability to acquire and rapidly disseminate a variety of spatially-referenced
    datasets to federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as the general
    public. Remote sensing technologies used for these projects have included lidar,
    high-resolution digital cameras, a film-based RC-30 aerial camera system, and
    hyperspectral imagers. Examples of rapid response initiatives include acquiring
    high resolution images with the Emerge/Applanix Digital Sensor System (DSS).',
