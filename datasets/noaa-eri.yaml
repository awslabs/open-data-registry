Name: NOAA Emergency Response Imagery
Description: In order to support NOAA's homeland security and emergency response requirements, the National Geodetic Survey Remote Sensing Division (NGS/RSD) has the capability to acquire and rapidly disseminate a variety of spatially-referenced datasets to federal, state, and local government agencies, as well as the general public. Remote sensing technologies used for these projects have included lidar, high-resolution digital cameras, a film-based RC-30 aerial camera system, and hyperspectral imagers. Examples of rapid response initiatives include acquiring high resolution images with the Emerge/Applanix Digital Sensor System (DSS).
