Name: NOAA U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid)
Description: |
  The NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid) consists of four climate variables derived from the GHCN-D dataset: maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature and precipitation. Each file provides monthly values in a 5x5 lat/lon grid for the Continental United States. Data is available from 1895 to the present. On an annual basis, approximately one year of "final" nClimGrid will be submitted to replace the initially supplied "preliminary" data for the same time period. Users should be sure to ascertain which level of data is required for their research.

  EpiNOAA is an analysis ready dataset that consists of a daily time-series of nClimGrid measures (maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation) at the county scale.  Each file provides daily values for the Continental United States. Data are available from 1951 to the present. Daily data are updated every 3 days with a preliminary data file and replaced with the scaled (i.e., quality controlled) data file every three months. This derivative data product is an enhancement from the original daily nClimGrid dataset in that all four weather parameters are now packaged into one file and assembled in a daily time-series format. In addition to a direct download option, an R package and web interface has been developed to streamline access to the final data product. These options allow end users three separate access modes to arrive at a customized dataset unique to each end userâ€™s application. Users should be sure to review the data documentation to inform which level of data is required for their research.
