Description: "The NOAA Monthly U.S. Climate Gridded Dataset (NClimGrid) consists of\
  \ four climate variables derived from the GHCN-D dataset: maximum temperature, minimum\
  \ temperature, average temperature and precipitation. Each file provides monthly\
  \ values in a 5x5 lat/lon grid for the Continental United States. Data is available\
  \ from 1895 to the present. On an annual basis, approximately one year of \"final\"\
  \ nClimGrid will be submitted to replace the initially supplied \"preliminary\"\
  \ data for the same time period. Users should be sure to ascertain which level of\
  \ data is required for their research.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nEpiNOAA is an analysis ready\
  \ dataset that consists of a daily time-series of nClimGrid measures (maximum temperature,\
  \ minimum temperature, average temperature, and precipitation) at the county scale.\
  \  Each file provides daily values for the Continental United States. Data are available\
  \ from 1951 to the present. Daily data are updated every 3 days with a preliminary\
  \ data file and replaced with the scaled (i.e., quality controlled) data file every\
  \ three months. This derivative data product is an enhancement from the original\
  \ daily nClimGrid dataset in that all four weather parameters are now packaged into\
  \ one file and assembled in a daily time-series format. In addition to a direct\
  \ download option, an R package and web interface has been developed to streamline\
  \ access to the final data product. These options allow end users three separate\
  \ access modes to arrive at a customized dataset unique to each end user\u2019s\
  \ application. Users should be sure to review the data documentation to inform which\
  \ level of data is required for their research.\n"
