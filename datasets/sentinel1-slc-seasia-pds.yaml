Description: 'The S1 Single Look Complex (SLC) dataset contains Synthetic Aperture
  Radar (SAR) data in the C-Band wavelength. The SAR sensors are installed on a two-satellite
  (Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) constellation orbiting the Earth with a combined revisit
  time of six days, operated by the European Space Agency. The S1 SLC data are a Level-1
  product that collects radar amplitude and phase information in all-weather, day
  or night conditions, which is ideal for studying natural hazards and emergency response,
  land applications, oil spill monitoring, sea-ice conditions, and associated climate
  change effects.
