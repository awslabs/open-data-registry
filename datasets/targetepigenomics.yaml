Description: 'The TaRGET (Toxicant Exposures and Responses by Genomic and Epigenomic
  Regulators of Transcription) Program is a research consortium funded by the National
  Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). The goal of the collaboration
  is to address the role of environmental exposures in disease pathogenesis as a function
  of epigenome perturbation, including understanding the environmental control of
  epigenetic mechanisms and assessing the utility of surrogate tissue analysis in
  mouse models of disease-relevant environmental exposures.
