Name: TARGET-ALL-P3 open data
Description: |
  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) is the collaborative
  effort of a large, diverse consortium of extramural and NCI investigators. The goal of the effort
  is to accelerate molecular discoveries that drive the initiation and progression of hard-to-treat
  childhood cancers and facilitate rapid translation of those findings into the clinic.

  Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is fast growing blood cancer in which too many immature white
  blood cells are found in the blood and bone marrow. TARGET-ALL projects provide comprehensive
  molecular characterization to determine the genetic changes that drive the initiation and
  progression of childhood ALL. The dataset contains TARGET-ALL Phase III (P3) open Clinical
  Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification, miRNA-Seq Isoform
  Expression Quantification, and miRNA Expression Quantification data from Genomic Data Commons
  (GDC), and open data from GDC Legacy Archive.
