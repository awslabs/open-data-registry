Name: Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) Soil Chemistry
Description: |
    This dataset contains soil infrared spectral data and paired soil property
    reference measurements for georeferenced soil samples that were collected
    through the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which lasted
    from 2009 through 2018. In this release, we include data collected during
    Phase I (2009-2013.) Georeferenced samples were collected from 19 countries
    in Sub-Saharan African using a statistically sound sampling scheme,
    and their soil properties were analyzed using *both* conventional soil
    testing methods and spectral methods (infrared diffuse reflectance
    spectroscopy). The two types of data can be paired to form a training
    dataset for machine learning, such that certain soil properties can be
    well-predicted through less expensive spectral techniques.
