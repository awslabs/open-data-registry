Description: 'This dataset contains soil infrared spectral data and paired soil property

  reference measurements for georeferenced soil samples that were collected

  through the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which lasted

  from 2009 through 2018. In this release, we include data collected during

  Phase I (2009-2013.) Georeferenced samples were collected from 19 countries

  in Sub-Saharan African using a statistically sound sampling scheme,

  and their soil properties were analyzed using *both* conventional soil

  testing methods and spectral methods (infrared diffuse reflectance

  spectroscopy). The two types of data can be paired to form a training

  dataset for machine learning, such that certain soil properties can be

  well-predicted through less expensive spectral techniques.
