Name: AfSIS Soil Chemistry
Description: This dataset contains field and laboratory data collected through the Africa Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which lasted from 2009 through 2018. In this initial release, we are including data collected during Phase I, which spanned from 2009 through 2013. Georeferenced soil samples were collected from many countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and their nutrient content was analyzed using *both* wet chemistry and dry chemistry. The two types of data can be paired to form a training dataset for machine learning, such that the chemical concentrations of certain nutrients can be well-predicted using less expensive dry chemistry techniques.
