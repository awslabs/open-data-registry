Name: AfSIS Soil Chemistry
Description: |
    This dataset contains field and laboratory data collected through the Africa 
    Soil Information Service (AfSIS) project, which lasted from 2009 through 2018. 
    In this initial release, we are including data collected during Phase I, which 
    spanned from 2009 through 2013. Georeferenced soil samples were collected from 
    many countries throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, and their nutrient content was 
    analyzed using *both* wet chemistry and dry chemistry. The two types of data 
    can be paired to form a training dataset for machine learning, such that the 
    chemical concentrations of certain nutrients can be well-predicted using less 
    expensive dry chemistry techniques.
