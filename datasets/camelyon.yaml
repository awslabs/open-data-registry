Description: '"This dataset contains the all data for the [CAncer MEtastases in LYmph
  nOdes challeNge or CAMELYON](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org). CAMELYON was
  the first challenge using whole-slide images in computational pathology and aimed
  to help pathologists identify breast cancer metastases in sentinel lymph nodes.
  Lymph node metastases are extremely important to find, as they indicate that the
  cancer is no longer localized and systemic treatment might be warranted. Searching
  for these metastases in H&E-stained tissue is difficult and time-consuming and AI
  algorithms can play a role in helping make this faster and more accurate.
