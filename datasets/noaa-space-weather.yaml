    ', Description: "Space weather forecast and observation data is collected and\
    \ disseminated by NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder,\
    \ CO. SWPC produces forecasts for multiple space weather phenomenon types and\
    \ the resulting impacts to Earth and human activities.  A variety of products\
    \ are available that provide these forecast expectations, and their respective\
    \ measurements, in formats that range from detailed technical forecast discussions\
    \ to NOAA Scale values to simple bulletins that give information in laymen's terms.\
    \ Forecasting is the prediction of future events, based on analysis and modeling\
    \ of the past and present conditions of the environment you are interested in.\
    \ In Space Weather, persistence and recurrence of active regions on the sun over\
    \ the 27-day solar rotational period play an important role in accurately forecasting\
    \ the space environment.\n", Documentation: 'https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/products-and-data',
