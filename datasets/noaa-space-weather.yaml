Name: NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) Forecasts
Description: >
  SWPC produces forecasts for multiple space weather phenomenon types and the resulting impacts to Earth and human activities.  A variety of products are available that provide these forecast expectations, and their respective measurements, in formats that range from detailed technical forecast discussions to NOAA Scale values to simple bulletins that give information in laymen's terms.
  Forecasting is the prediction of future events, based on analysis and modeling of the past and present conditions of the environment you are interested in. In Space Weather, persistence and recurrence of active regions on the sun over the 27-day solar rotational period play an important role in accurately forecasting the space environment.
