Description: The Australian National Mooring Network (ANMN) Facility is a series of
  national reference stations and regional moorings designed to monitor particular
  oceanographic phenomena in Australian coastal ocean waters. This collection contains
  time-series observations of temperature and salinity from moorings deployed by the
  ANMN. The primary parameters are temperature, pressure (when available) and depth
  of the instrument. A subset of this collection also includes conductivity and salinity.
  The observations were made using a range of temperature loggers, conductivity-temperature-depth
  (CTD) instruments, and temperature sensors on acoustic Doppler current profilers
  (ADCPs). We are also producing a gridded product of temperature time-series profiles
  based on these data. These will be available in a separate collection.
