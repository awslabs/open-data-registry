Name: Sentinel-1 Monthly Mosaic
Description: |
  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensor have the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover and can acquire data over a site during the day or night. The Sentinel-1 mission, part of the Copernicus joint initiative by the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA), provides reliable and repeated wide-area monitoring using its SAR instrument.Sentinel-1 Monthly Mosaics are analysis-ready product of individual Sentinel-1 acquisitions. Sentinel-1 monthly mosaics are generated from Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) backscatter data, with variations from changing observation geometries mitigated. RTC images acquired within a calendar month are combined using a multitemporal compositing algorithm. This algorithm calculates a weighted average of valid pixels, assigning higher weights to pixels with higher local resolution (e.g., slopes facing away from the sensor). This local resolution weighting approach minimizes noise and improves spatial homogeneity in the composites. Sinergise (Planet Labs) processed and indexed the product on the DE Africa platform
