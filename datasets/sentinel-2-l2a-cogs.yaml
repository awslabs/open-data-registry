Description: 'The [Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2)
  is

  a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution

  optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions.

  The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth''s land surface every 5 days,

  making the data of great use in ongoing studies.

  This dataset is the same as the [Sentinel-2](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/)

  dataset, except the JP2K files were converted into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs).

  Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata has were in a JSON file

  alongside the data, and a STAC API called [Earth-search](https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0)

  is freely available to search the archive. This dataset contains all of the scenes
  in the

  original Sentinel-2 Public Dataset and will grow as that does.

  L2A data are available from April 2017 over wider Europe region and globally since
  December 2018.

  they are available on Copernicus OpenHub.
