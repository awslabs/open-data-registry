Name: Sentinel-2 Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs
Description: |
  The [Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) is
  a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution
  optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions.
  The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 5 days,
  making the data of great use in ongoing studies.
  This dataset is the same as the [Sentinel-2](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2/)
  dataset, except the JP2K files were converted into Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs).
  Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata has were in a JSON file
  alongside the data, and a STAC API called [Earth-search](https://earth-search.aws.element84.com/v0)
  is freely available to search the archive. This dataset contains all of the scenes in the
  original Sentinel-2 Public Dataset and will grow as that does.
  L2A data are available from April 2017 over wider Europe region and globally since December 2018.
