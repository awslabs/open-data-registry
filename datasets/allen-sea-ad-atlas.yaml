Description: "The Seattle Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Brain Cell Atlas (SEA-AD) consortium\
  \ strives to gain a deep molecular and cellular understanding of the early pathogenesis\
  \ of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and is funded by the National Institutes on Aging\
  \ (NIA U19AG060909). The SEA-AD datasets available here comprise single cell profiling\
  \ (transcriptomics and epigenomics) and quantitative neuropathology. To explore\
  \ gene expression and chromatin accessibility information, the single-cell profiling\
  \ data includes: snRNAseq and snATAC-seq data from the SEA-AD donor cohort (aged\
  \ brains which span the spectrum of Alzheimer's Disease pathology) and neurotypical\
  \ reference brains. To explore key pathological proteins and cell types of interest\
  \ to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, the neuropathology data includes: full resolution\
  \ brightfield images, images processed and segmented in HALO\xAE image analysis\
  \ software, image annotations, and quantification summary files for the relevant\
  \ stains including Abeta (6E10), IBA1, a-Synuclein, GFAP, H&E-LFB, NeuN, pTau(AT8),\
  \ and pTDP43.\n"
