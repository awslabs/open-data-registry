Description: 'This study generated a collection of patient-derived pancreatic normal
  and cancer organoids and it was sequenced using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), Whole
  Exome Sequencing (WXS) and RNA-Seq as well as matched tumor and normal tissue if
  available. The study provides a valuable resource for pancreatic cancer researchers.

  The dataset contains open RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data and controlled
  WGS/WXS/RNA-Seq Aligned Reads, WXS Annotated Somatic Mutation, WXS Raw Somatic Mutation,
  and RNA-Seq Splice Junction Quantification.
