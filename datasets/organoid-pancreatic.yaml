Name: Pancreatic Cancer Organoid Profiling
Description: |
  The study generated a collection of patient-derived pancreatic normal and cancer organoids and it
  was sequenced using WGS, WXS and RNA-Seq as well as matched tumor and normal tissue if available.
  The study provides a valuable resource for pancreatic cancer researchers. The dataset contains open
  RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data.
