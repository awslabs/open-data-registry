Name: Pancreatic Cancer Organoid Profiling
Description: >
  This study generated a collection of patient-derived pancreatic normal and cancer organoids and it
  was sequenced using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS) and RNA-Seq as well as matched tumor and normal tissue if available.
  The study provides a valuable resource for pancreatic cancer researchers.
  
  The dataset contains open RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data and controlled WGS/WXS/RNA-Seq Aligned Reads, WXS Annotated Somatic
  Mutation, WXS Raw Somatic Mutation, and RNA-Seq Splice Junction Quantification.
