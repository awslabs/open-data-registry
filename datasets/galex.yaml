Name: Galaxy Evolution Explorer Satellite (GALEX)
Description: |
  The Galaxy Evolution Explorer Satellite (GALEX) was a NASA mission led by the California Institute of Technology, whose primary goal was to investigate how star formation in galaxies evolved from the early universe up to the present. GALEX used microchannel plate detectors to obtain direct images in the near-UV (NUV) and far-UV (FUV), and a grism to disperse light for low resolution spectroscopy.
