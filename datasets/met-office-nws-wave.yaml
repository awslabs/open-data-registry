Name: Met Office NWS Wave model on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: |
 Northwest European continental shelf regional wave model predicting sea-state and various sea and swell wave characteristics for waters surrounding the UK.
 
 The Met Office runs global and regional wave forecast models to support marine safety and operational decision making.
 Met Office configurations are developed to be run using the community wave model WAVEWATCH IIITM.
 The global wave configuration is designed to generate accurate forecasts for open waters of the world's oceans and larger seas,
 whilst regional configurations are run in order to improve accuracy closer to the coast.
 The Met Office wave models are forced using wind data from the Met Office Global Atmospheric Hi-Res Model and, where
 appropriate in regional configurations, currents from the Met Office shelf seas model.

 Met Office NWS Wave (UK wave) Model 6 day forecast to provide an outlook for wave characteristics defining height, period and direction of waves within a given sea-state.
 The model uses a refined grid system in order to better represent fetch in constrained sea areas and blocking effects of
 islands and headlands. Data are released at the model's base resolution of 0.030303 degrees longitude by 0.0135135 degrees latitude
 approximating to a 1.5km grid with a daily update cycle	at 00, 06, 12, 18z
