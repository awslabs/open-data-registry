Description: Australasian Genomes is the genomic data repository for the Threatened
  Species Initiative (TSI) and the ARC Centre for Innovations in Peptide and Protein
  Science (CIPPS). This repository contains reference genomes, transcriptomes, resequenced
  genomes and reduced representation sequencing data from Australasian species. Australasian
  Genomes is managed by the Australasian Wildlife Genomics Group (AWGG) at the University
  of Sydney on behalf of our collaborators within TSI and CIPPS.
