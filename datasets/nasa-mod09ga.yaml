Name: MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 1km and 500m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The MOD09GA Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface
  spectral reflectance of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
  Bands 1 through 7, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols,
  and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 500 meter (m) surface reflectance,
  observation, and quality bands are a set of ten 1 kilometer (km) observation bands
  and geolocation flags. The reflectance layers from the MOD09GA are used as the source
  data for many of the MODIS land products. \n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information
  about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
