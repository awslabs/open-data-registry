Name: MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance 8-Day L3 Global 500m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra MOD09A1
  Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance of
  Terra MODIS Bands 1 through 7 corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses,
  aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the seven 500 meter (m) reflectance
  bands are two quality layers and four observation bands. For each pixel, a value
  is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8-day composite period. The criteria
  for the pixel choice include cloud and solar zenith. When several acquisitions meet
  the criteria the pixel with the minimum channel 3 (blue) value is used. \n\nKnown
  Issues\n* For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS
  Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
