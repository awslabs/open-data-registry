Description: "The IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway CO2 Measurements group is a research\
  \ and data collection project working within the IMOS Ship of Opportunity Multi-Disciplinary\
  \ Underway Network sub-facility. The CO2 group sample critical regions of the Southern\
  \ Ocean and the Australian shelf waters have a major impact on CO2 uptake by the\
  \ ocean. These are regions where biogeochemical cycling is predicted to be particularly\
  \ sensitive to a changing climate. The pCO2 Underway System measures the fugacity\
  \ of carbon dioxide (fCO2) along with other variables such as sea surface salinity\
  \ (SSS) and sea surface temperature (SST) using an automated system. The data represented\
  \ by this record are presented in delayed mode. \n\nThe RV Aurora Australis provides\
  \ data on surface ocean CO2 for the Southern Ocean, while the Southern Surveyor\
  \ and its replacement in 2014, RV Investigator, covers shelf and offshore waters\
  \ around Australia from the tropics to the sea-ice edge. The  RV L'Astrolabe is\
  \ also used to collect data on route from Tasmania to Dumont d'Urville station,\
  \ Antarctica. The New Zealand National Institute of Water & Atmospheric Research\
  \ Ltd. (NIWA) has supported the setup of underway CO2 measurements on the RV Tangaroa.\
  \ The Tangaroa covers oceans adjacent to New Zealand."
