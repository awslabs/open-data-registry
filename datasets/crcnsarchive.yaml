Name: Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience
Description: |
  CRCNS.org is a repository of high quality neuroscience datasets which are expected to be
  useful for testing computational models of the brain and new analysis methods.  The data
  include physiological recordings from sensory and memory systems, as well as eye movement
  and other behavioral data.  The repository and sharing of the data sets was initially funded
  by the NSF CRCNS (Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience) program.

UpdateFrequency: Once the data is in place, it will probably be updated rarely (just a few times each year).
