    Title: Sample Queries on the 1000 Genomes, gnomAD and ClinVar data Lake
    URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-genomics-datalake/blob/main/1000Genomes.ipynb
Description: 'The [Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/)
  is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators that aggregates
  and harmonizes both exome and genome data from a wide range of large-scale human
  sequencing projects

  Sign up for the gnomAD mailing list [here](http://broad.io/gnomad_list). This dataset
  was derived from summary data from gnomAD release 3.1, available on the [Registry
  of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/broad-gnomad/) for ready enrollment
  into the [Data Lake as Code](https://github.com/aws-samples/data-lake-as-code/tree/blog).
