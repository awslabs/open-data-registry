Name: Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) - Data Lakehouse Ready
Description: |
  The [Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators that aggregates and harmonizes both exome and genome data from a wide range of large-scale human sequencing projects
  Sign up for the gnomAD mailing list [here](http://broad.io/gnomad_list). This dataset was derived from summary data from gnomAD release 3.1, available on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/broad-gnomad/) for ready enrollment into the [Data Lake as Code](https://github.com/aws-samples/data-lake-as-code/tree/blog).
