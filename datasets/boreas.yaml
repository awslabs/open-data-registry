Name: Boreas Autonomous Driving Dataset
Description: This autonomous driving dataset includes data from a 128-beam Velodyne Alpha-Prime lidar, a 5MP Blackfly camera, a 360-degree Navtech radar, and post-processed Applanix POS LV GNSS data. This dataset was collect in various weather conditions (sun, rain, snow) over the course of a year. The intended purpose of this dataset is to enable benchmarking of long-term all-weather odometry and metric localization across various sensor types. In the future, we hope to also support an object detection benchmark.
