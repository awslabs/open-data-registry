Name: NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) Hierarchical Testing Framework (HTF)
Description: |
  The "[Unified Forecast System](https://ufs.epic.noaa.gov/)" (UFS) is a community-based, coupled, comprehensive Earth Modeling System. The Hierarchical Testing Framework (HTF) serves as a comprehensive toolkit designed to enhance the testing capabilities within UFS "[repositories](https://github.com/ufs-community)". It aims to standardize and simplify the testing process across various "[UFS Weather Model](https://github.com/ufs-community/ufs-weather-model)" (WM) components and associated modules, aligning with the Hierarchical System Development (HSD) approach and NOAA baseline operational metrics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The HTF provides a structured methodology for test case design and execution, which enhances code management practices, fosters user accessibility, and promotes adherence to established testing protocols. It enables developers to conduct testing efficiently and consistently, ensuring code integrity and reliability through the use of established technologies such as CMake and CTest. When integrated with containerization techniques, the HTF facilitates portability of test cases and promotes reproducibility across different computing environments. This approach reduces the computational overhead and enhances collaboration within the UFS community by providing a unified testing framework.
