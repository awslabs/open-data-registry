Description: 'As of March, 2023 the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) High Resolution
  Science Experiment (HiRISE) sensor has collected more than 5000 targeted stereopairs.
  During HiRISE acquisition, the Context Camera (CTX) also collects lower resolution,
  higher spatial extent context images. These CTX acquisitions are also targeted stereopairs.
  This data set contains targeted CTX DTMs and orthoimages, created using the NASA
  Ames Stereopipeline. These data have been created using relatively controlled CTX
  images that have been globally bundle adjusted using the USGS Integrated System
  for Imagers and Spectrometers (ISIS) jigsaw application. Relative control at global
  scale reduces common issues such as spacecraft jitter in the resulting DTMs. DTMs
  were aligned as part of 26 different groupings to the ultimate MOLA product using
  an iterative pc_align approach. Therefore, all DTMs and orthoimages are absolutely
  controlled to MOLA, a proxy product for the Mars geodetic coordinate reference frame.
