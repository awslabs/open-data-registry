Name: ARCO-OCEAN
Description: |
  ARCO-OCEAN is an analysis-ready cloud-optimized dataset providing physical properties of the ocean, waves, and sea ice for a period of about 28 years between the 1st of January 1993 and the 30th of June 2021. The dataset includes also atmospheric and hydrological variables that would be needed as boundary conditions and used to drive a numerical simulation. The dataset is the result of collecting, processing, merging and optimizing for the cloud different data sources, all retrospective analyses (reanalyses) or hindcasts of different Earth system components. The dataset has been designed with machine learning in mind, and takes inspiration from similar datasets derived from ERA5.
