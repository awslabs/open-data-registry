Name: CBERS on AWS
Description: |
  This project creates a S3 repository with imagery acquired
  by the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). The
  image files are recorded and processed by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa
  Espaciais (INPE) and are converted to Cloud Optimized Geotiff
  format in order to optimize its use for cloud based applications.
  Currently the repository contains all CBERS-4 MUX scenes acquired since
  the start of the satellite mission. Scenes from CBERS-4 AWFI, PAN5M
  and PAN10M cameras acquired since Jun/2018 are also ingested daily,
  and the complete archive for these cameras will be ingested no later
  than Sep/2018.
