Name: CBERS on AWS
Description: |
  This project creates a S3 repository with imagery acquired
  by the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS). The
  image files are recorded and processed by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisa
  Espaciais (INPE) and are converted to Cloud Optimized Geotiff
  format in order to optimize its use for cloud based applications.
  Currently the repository contains all CBERS-4 MUX images acquired since
  the start of the CBERS-4 mission.
