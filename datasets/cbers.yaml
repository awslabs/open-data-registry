Description: 'Imagery acquired

  by the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS), 4 and 4A.

  The

  image files are recorded and processed by Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas

  Espaciais (INPE) and are converted to Cloud Optimized Geotiff

  format in order to optimize its use for cloud based applications.

  Contains all CBERS-4 MUX, AWFI, PAN5M and

  PAN10M scenes acquired since

  the start of the satellite mission and is daily updated with

  new scenes.

  CBERS-4 PAN5M and PAN10M starting from 05-2022 are temporarily not ingested

  due to an error in the bands identification on INPE''s catalog.

  CBERS-4A MUX Level 4 (Orthorectified) scenes are being

  ingested starting from 04-13-2021. CBERS-4A WFI Level 4 (Orthorectified)
