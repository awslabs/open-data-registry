Name: NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network Hourly (GHCN-H)
Description: |
  Global Historical Climatology Network - Hourly is a
  dataset from NOAA that contains daily observations over
  global land areas. It contains station-based measurements
  from land-based stations worldwide, about two thirds of which
  are for precipitation measurement only. Other meteorological
  elements include, but are not limited to, daily maximum and
  minimum temperature, temperature at the time of observation,
  snowfall and snow depth. It is a composite of climate records
  from numerous sources that were merged together and subjected
  to a common suite of quality assurance reviews.  Some data are
  more than 175 years old. The data is in CSV format. Each file
  corresponds to a year from 1763 to present and is named as such.
