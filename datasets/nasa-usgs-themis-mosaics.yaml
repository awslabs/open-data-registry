Name: NASA / USGS Controlled THEMIS Mosaics
Description: |
    These data are infrared image mosaics, tiled to the Mars quadrangle, generated using Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) images from the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter mission. The mosaic is generated at the full resolution of the THEMIS infrared dataset, which is approximately 100 meters/pixel. The mosaic was absolutely photogrammetrically controlled to an improved Viking MDIM network that was develop by the USGS Astrogeology processing group using the Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers. Image-to-image alignment precision is subpixel (i.e., <100m). These 8-bit, qualitative data are released as losslessly compressed Cloud Optimized GeoTiffs (COGs). Data are released using simple cylindrical (planetocentric positive East, center longitude 0, -180 to 180 longitude domain).
