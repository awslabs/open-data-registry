Name: Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Diffuse attenuation coefficient (k490)
Description: The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight
  reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral
  measurements are used to infer the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd) at 490nm
  wavelength which provides information on how light is attenuated in the water column.
  It is defined as the scaling length of the exponential decrease of the downwelling
  irradiance and has units (m^-1). The MODIS K490 product estimates Kd at 490nm wavelength,
  using a semi-empirical model based on the ratio of water leaving radiances at 490nm
  and 555nm. The algorithm is described at https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/kd/.
