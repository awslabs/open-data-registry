Name: Brain Data Science Database 1
Description: This collection unifies multiple brain datasets spanning critical care, sleep medicine, cardiopulmonary health, infectious diseases, and other aspects of clinical neuroscience. It includes a variety of types of clinical neuroscience data including electroencephalography (EEG) and polysomnography (PSG) recordings, and supporting data to enable research in diverse areas of clinical neuroscience such as epilepsy, delirium, coma, and sleep medicine. All data is de-identified and includes code to reproduce results in accompanying research publications. The data is available for non-commercial research use and is open access.
