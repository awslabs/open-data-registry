Name: Morphological Prediction of CPAP Associated Acute Respiratory Instability (Self Similarity)
Description: >
  This dataset provides the data and code accompanying the research on a self-similarity (SS) algorithm
  developed to detect high loop gain (HLG) from standard respiratory effort signals. The SS metric
  demonstrated strong predictive performance for CPAP failure across 2,145 split-night polysomnography (PSG)
  recordings from MGH and external validation from home sleep apnea tests. This approach supports more
  accurate and noninvasive phenotyping of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients for precision treatment strategies.
