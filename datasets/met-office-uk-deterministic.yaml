Name: Met Office UK Deterministic (UKV)2km on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: |
 THIS DATASET IS CHANGING
 Files uploaded from late January 2026 onward will contain changes including:
 - precision changes
 - new parameters
 - changes to existing parameters e.g. adding vertical levels and timesteps
 - the height_asl_on_pressure_levels parameter will be replaced by geopotential_height_on_pressure_levels
 
 Please check your systems are prepared for these changes.

 A high-resolution gridded weather forecast for the UK, with a resolution of 0.018 degrees, projected on to a 2km horizontal grid. The data is available as NetCDF files. It's offered on a free, unsupported basis, so we don’t recommend using it for any critical business purposes.
 
 Based on the Met Office UKV model, which is a deterministic, numerical weather prediction model for the UK and Ireland. It is a UK configuration of the Unified Model, which is the Met Office’s flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model.
 
 The archive contains data from the past two years. The data is typically available approximately 3 to 6 hours after the model run time.
 
 The following timesteps are available:
 - every hour from 0 to 54 hours (for most parameters)
 - every 3 hours from 57 to 120 hours
 
 For some parameters, data is available for multiple vertical height or pressure levels through the atmosphere.
UpdateFrequency: |
  There are three lengths of model run, each with its own update frequency:
  - Nowcast: forecasts the next 12 hours and runs at 0100, 0200, 0400, 0500, 0700, 0800, 1000, 1100, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1700, 1900, 2000, 2200 and 2300 UTC.
  - Short: forecasts the next 54 hours and runs at 0000, 0600, 0900, 1200, 1800 and 2100 UTC.
  - Medium: forecasts the next 120 hours and runs at 0300 and 1500 UTC.
