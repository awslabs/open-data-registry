Name: Met Office UK Deterministic (UKV)2km on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified Model, the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office runs several configurations of the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite. Uncovering 2 years' worth of historical data, updated regularly with a time delay.
  The UK deterministic model is a post processed regional downscaled configuration of the Unified Model, covering the UK and Ireland, with a resolution of approximately 0.018 degrees. The United Kingdom domain is a 1,096km x 1,408km (2km resolution grid). Formatted via NetCDF.
  Please note this is a public beta and therefore a non-operational service.
