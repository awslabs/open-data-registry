Name: MODIS/Terra Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 250m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The MOD09GQ Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface
  spectral reflectance of Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
  250 meter (m) bands 1 and 2, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses,
  aerosols, and Rayleigh scattering. Along with the 250 m surface reflectance bands
  are the Quality Assurance (QA) layer and five observation layers. This product is
  intended to be used in conjunction with the quality and viewing geometry information
  of the 500 m product (MOD09GA). \n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about
  known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
