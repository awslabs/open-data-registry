Name: Daylight Map Distribution of OpenStreetMap
Description: |
  Daylight is a complete distribution of global, open map data thatâ€™s freely available with support from community and professional mapmakers. Meta combines the work of global contributors to projects like OpenStreetMap with quality and consistency checks from Daylight mapping partners to create a free, stable, and easy-to-use street-scale global map. The Daylight Map Distribution contains a validated subset of the OpenStreetMap database. In addition to the standard OpenStreetMap PBF format, Daylight is available in two parquet formats that are optimized for AWS Athena including geometries (Points, LineStrings, Polygons, or MultiPolygons). First, **Daylight OSM Features** contains the nearly 1B renderable OSM features. Second, **Daylight OSM Elements** contains all of OSM, including all 7B nodes without attributes, and relations that do not contain geometries, such as turn restrictions.
