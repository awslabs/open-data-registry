Name:  RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT (RATIC)
Description: "Blunt force abdominal trauma is among the most common types of traumatic injury, with the most frequent cause being motor vehicle accidents. Abdominal trauma may result in damage and internal bleeding of the internal organs, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bowel. Detection and classification of injuries are key to effective treatment and favorable outcomes. A large proportion of patients with abdominal trauma require urgent surgery. Abdominal trauma often cannot be diagnosed clinically by physical exam, patient symptoms, or laboratory tests. Prompt diagnosis of abdominal trauma using medical imaging is thus critical to patient care. AI tools that assist and expedite diagnosis of abdominal trauma have the potential to substantially improve patient care and health outcomes in the emergency setting. To create the ground truth dataset, RSNA collected imaging data sourced from 23 sites in 14 countries on six continents, including more than 4,000 CT exams with various abdominal injuries and a roughly equal number of cases without injury."
