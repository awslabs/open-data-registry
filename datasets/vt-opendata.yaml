Name: Vermont Open Geospatial on AWS
Description: The State of Vermont has partnered with Amazon's Open Data Initative to make a wide range of geospatial data available in the public domain. Vermont acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions. The imagery typically ranges from 30-centimeter to 15-centimeter in resolution and is available from Vermont's Amazon S3 bucket in a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff (COG) format. LiDAR data has been acquired and is available as USGS Quality Level-1 (QL1) and Level-2 (QL2) compliant datasets in COG format. Geospatial datasets derived from imagery and/or lidar are also available as COGs, including high resolution landcover.

UpdateFrequency: Vermont acquires statewide imagery approximately once every other year. Lidar is acquired approximately once every 5-8 years. High-resolution landcover is generated once every other year.

  - Description: Elevation datsets (primarily lidar based) are organized in this bucket as statewide file mosaics and by acquisition year (often a portion of the state in any given year). These data are available in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format and use the following naming convention; 1) Statewide COGs - STATEWIDE_<AQYEAR-AQYEAR>_<RESOLUTION>cm_<DERIVATIVE>, 2) By Acquisition Year - <AQYEAR>_<RESOLUTION>cm_<DERIVATIVE>. Individual tiles are also available as lossless COGs under the ./_Tiles subfolder.
