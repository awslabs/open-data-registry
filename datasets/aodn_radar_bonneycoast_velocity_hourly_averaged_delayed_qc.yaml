Name: Ocean Radar - Bonney coast site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: "The Bonney Coast (BONC) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the\
  \ Bonney Coast, South Australia, which has a recurring annual upwelling feature\
  \ near to the coast that significantly changes the ecosystem from one of warm water\
  \ originating in Western Australia, to one dominated by cold upwelling water from\
  \ off the continental shelf.  The dynamics of this area and the relationship between\
  \ ocean circulation, chemistry and sediments control the larval species and the\
  \ higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.  \n\nThe data from\
  \ this site provide linking observations between the Southern Ocean and NSW through\
  \ processes that occur on weekly to El Nino time scales.  \n\nThe BONC HF ocean\
  \ radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations\
  \ located at Nora Creina (37.329 S 139.850 E) and Blackfellows Cave (37.940 S 140.457\
  \ E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz, with a bandwidth of 50\
  \ KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 3 Km.  Within the HF\
  \ radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\nThis site was decommissioned\
  \ in March 2017."
