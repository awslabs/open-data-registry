Description: Dataset and benchmarks for computer vision research in the context of
  autonomous driving. The dataset has been recorded in and around the city of Karlsruhe,
  Germany using the mobile platform AnnieWay (VW station wagon) which has been equipped
  with several RGB and monochrome cameras, a Velodyne HDL 64 laser scanner as well
  as an accurate RTK corrected GPS/IMU localization unit. The dataset has been created
  for computer vision and machine learning research on stereo, optical flow, visual
  odometry, semantic segmentation, semantic instance segmentation, road segmentation,
  single image depth prediction, depth map completion, 2D and 3D object detection
  and object tracking. In addition, several raw data recordings are provided. The
  datasets are captured by driving around the mid-size city of Karlsruhe, in rural
  areas and on highways. Up to 15 cars and 30 pedestrians are visible per image.
