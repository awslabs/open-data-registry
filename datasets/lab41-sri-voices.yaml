Name: Voices Obscured in Complex Environmental Settings (VOiCES)
Description: |
  VOiCES is a speech corpus recorded in acoustically challenging settings,
  using distant microphone recording. Speech was recorded in real rooms with various
  acoustic features (reverb, echo, HVAC systems, outside noise, etc.). Adversarial noise,
  either television, music, or babble, was concurrently played with clean speech.
  Data was recorded using multiple microphones strategically placed
  throughout the room. The corpus includes audio recordings, orthographic transcriptions,
  and speaker labels.
