    Title: Getting started with VOiCES data
    URL: https://github.com/voices18/utilities/blob/master/Using%20VOiCES%20corpus%20tutorial.ipynb
Description: 'VOiCES is a speech corpus recorded in acoustically challenging settings,

  using distant microphone recording. Speech was recorded in real rooms with various

  acoustic features (reverb, echo, HVAC systems, outside noise, etc.). Adversarial
  noise,

  either television, music, or babble, was concurrently played with clean speech.

  Data was recorded using multiple microphones strategically placed

  throughout the room. The corpus includes audio recordings, orthographic transcriptions,

  and speaker labels.
