Description: A centralized sequence repository for all records containing sequence
  associated with the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) submitted to the National Center
  for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Included are both
  the original sequences submitted by the principal investigator as well as SRA-processed
  sequences that require the SRA Toolkit for analysis. Additionally, submitter provided
  metadata included in associated BioSample and BioProject records is available alongside
  NCBI calculated data, such k-mer based taxonomy analysis results, contiguous assemblies
  (contigs) and associated statistics such as contig length, blast results for the
  assembled contigs, contig annotation, blast databases of contigs and their annotated
  peptides, and VCF files generated for each record relative to the SARS-CoV-2 RefSeq
  record. Finally, metadata is additionally made available in parquet format to facilitate
  search and filtering using the AWS Athena Service.

  Description: Genomic sequence reads of SARS-CoV-2 and related coronaviridae, organized
    by NCBI accession. Files in the `sra-src` folder are in FASTQ, BAM, or CRAM format
    (original submission); files in the  `run` folder are in .sra format and require
