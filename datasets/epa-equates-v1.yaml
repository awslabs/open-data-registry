  Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) 2019 3D Gridded and Column data from
  the EPA's Air Quality Time Series (EQUATES) Project
Description: >-
  The data are part of EPA’s Air Quality Time Series (EQUATES) Project.  The
  data consist of hourly gridded pollutant concentrations estimates by the
  Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model version 5.3.2
  (https://doi.org/10.15139/S3/F2KJSK) for January 1 – December 31, 2019.  Model
  data is provided for two spatial domains :  the Northern Hemisphere (108 km x
  108km horizontal grid spacing) and the Contiguous United States including
  parts of Canada and Mexico (12km x 12km horizontal grid spacing).  Two types
  of hourly data are provided: three-dimensional air pollutant concentrations
  and vertical column pollutant totals. Previous studies have used this type of
  CMAQ 3D and vertical column air quality data to evaluate the modeling system,
  created model-observed ‘fused’ surfaces, and to analyze spatial and temporal
  changes in air quality in the upper atmosphere, e.g.,

  - Description: >-
      The 2019 CMAQ output are stored as compressed netcdf/hdf5 formatted files
      using I/O API data structures (https://www.cmascenter.org/ioapi/).
      Information on the model projection and grid structure is contained in the
      header information of the netcdf file. The netcdf files can be opened and
      manipulated using I/O API utilities (e.g. M3XTRACT, M3WNDW) or other
      software programs that can read and write netcdf formatted files (e.g.
      Fortran, R, Python).
