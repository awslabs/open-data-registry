Description: This dataset is Lidar data that has been collected by the Scottish public
  sector and made available under the Open Government Licence. The data are available
  as point cloud (LAS format or in LAZ compressed format), along with the derived
  Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) products as Cloud optimized
  GeoTIFFs (COG) or standard GeoTIFF. The dataset contains multiple subsets of data
  which were each commissioned and flown in response to different organisational requirements.
  The details of each can be found at https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/data#/list
Documentation: https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/data#/list
License: All data is made available under the [Open Government Licence v3](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)
  unless otherwise stated. Currently the exception is only the phase 2 - LAZ files
  which are under [non-commercial government license](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/non-commercial-government-licence/version/2/).
