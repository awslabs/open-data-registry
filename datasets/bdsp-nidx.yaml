Name: NIDX - A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying People with Neuroinfectious Diseases in Electronic Health Records
Version: 1.0
Description: We developed an XGBoost machine learning model using EHR notes to identify neuroinfectious diseases. The model showed strong performance on both internal (MGB) and external (BIDMC) datasets, surpassing ICD code methods and LLaMA 3.2 zero-shot classification.
