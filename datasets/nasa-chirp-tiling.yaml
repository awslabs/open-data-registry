Name: NASA CHIRP Radiance Product
Description: |
  Climate Hyperspectral Infrared Radiance Product (CHIRP) provides a stable climate-quality radiance time series spanning AIRS and CrIS. 
  The primary CHIRP SS1330 continuous record starts with Aqua-AIRS in Fall 2002 and crosses over to SNPP-CrIS then to JPSS-1-CrIS. 
  When not writing to the primary product, a CHIRP-CAL product is created for each mission. These CHIRP Tiles contain V2 CHIRP spectra binned 
  for a 16-day period (orbital repeat period) in 64 by 72 latitude/longitude tiles on a global Mercator projection grid. Indexing starts from 
  the lower left (lat,lon) at (1,1). Set 1 corresponds to the 16-day period beginning on September 1, 2002 with the AIRS mission. 
  SNPP CHIRP Tiles start with set 302 on November 8, 2015 and ends at 428, May 21, 2021. JPSS-1 CHIRP Tiles start with set 354 on Feb 17, 2018.
