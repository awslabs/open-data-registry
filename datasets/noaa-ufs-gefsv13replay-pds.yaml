Name: NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) Version 13 Replay
Description: |
  The NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) / Global Ensemble Forecast System version 13 (GEFSv13) Replay dataset supports the retrospective forecast archive in preparation for GEFSv13 / GFSv17. It includes a range of atmospheric and oceanic variables—such as temperature, humidity, winds, salinity, and currents—covering global conditions at a nominal horizontal resolution of ¼ degree, enabling detailed weather analysis.

  The dataset was generated by replaying the coupled UFS model against pre-existing external reanalyses; ERA5 for atmospheric data and ORAS5 for ocean and ice dynamics. Each simulation stream was initialized from these reanalyses, which were pre-processed for the UFS model components, including the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3; 25 km, 127 vertical levels) and the Modular Ocean Model (MOM6; ¼ degree tri-polar grid, 72 vertical levels). This replay methodology enforces a predetermined model state while allowing cross-component fluxes and unconstrained processes to be computed.

  For the land surface, NOAA’s JEDI-based land data assimilation system incorporated snow depth observations from the NCEI Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and satellite-derived snow cover from the U.S. National Ice Center. The JEDI Sea-ice Ocean and Coupled Analysis system (SOCA) adjusted sea-ice thickness and concentration for consistency with ORAS5.

  The original dataset spanned January 1994 to October 2023, with plans for ongoing updates and a 1-degree version covering 1958 to 2023. The dataset is hosted on AWS and GCP cloud services, courtesy of the NOAA Open Data Dissemination program. Original model outputs are stored in AWS, while a curated version in Zarr format is available on GCP for analysis and AI training pipelines (see https://psl.noaa.gov/data/ufs_replay/ for details).
