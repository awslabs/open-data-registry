  Description: "The NOAA Unified Forecast System (UFS) / Global Ensemble Forecast\
    \ System version 13 (GEFSv13) Replay dataset supports the retrospective forecast\
    \ archive in preparation for GEFSv13 / GFSv17. It includes a range of atmospheric\
    \ and oceanic variables\u2014such as temperature, humidity, winds, salinity, and\
    \ currents\u2014covering global conditions at a nominal horizontal resolution\
    \ of \xBC degree, enabling detailed weather analysis.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dataset\
    \ was generated by replaying the coupled UFS model against pre-existing external\
    \ reanalyses; ERA5 for atmospheric data and ORAS5 for ocean and ice dynamics.\
    \ Each simulation stream was initialized from these reanalyses, which were pre-processed\
    \ for the UFS model components, including the GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere\
    \ Dynamical Core (FV3; 25 km, 127 vertical levels) and the Modular Ocean Model\
    \ (MOM6; \xBC degree tri-polar grid, 72 vertical levels). This replay methodology\
    \ enforces a predetermined model state while allowing cross-component fluxes and\
    \ unconstrained processes to be computed.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the land surface,\
    \ NOAA\u2019s JEDI-based land data assimilation system incorporated snow depth\
    \ observations from the NCEI Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and\
    \ satellite-derived snow cover from the U.S. National Ice Center. The JEDI Sea-ice\
    \ Ocean and Coupled Analysis system (SOCA) adjusted sea-ice thickness and concentration\
    \ for consistency with ORAS5.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe original dataset spanned January\
    \ 1994 to October 2023, with plans for ongoing updates and a 1-degree version\
    \ covering 1958 to 2023. The dataset is hosted on AWS and GCP cloud services,\
    \ courtesy of the NOAA Open Data Dissemination program. Original model outputs\
    \ are stored in AWS, while a curated version in Zarr format is available on GCP\
    \ for analysis and AI training pipelines (see https://psl.noaa.gov/data/ufs_replay/\
    \ for details).\n", Documentation: 'https://psl.noaa.gov/data/ufs_replay/', License: 'NOAA
