Name:  RSNA Cervical Spine Fracture Detection (RSNA-CSF) Dataset
Description: "Over 1.5 million spine fractures occur annually in the United States alone resulting in over 17,730 spinal cord injuries annually. The most common site of spine fracture is the cervical spine. There has been a rise in the incidence of spinal fractures in the elderly and in this population, fractures can be more difficult to detect on imaging due to degenerative disease and osteoporosis. Imaging diagnosis of adult spine fractures is now almost exclusively performed with computed tomography (CT). Quickly detecting and determining the location of any vertebral fractures is essential to prevent neurologic deterioration and paralysis after trauma. RSNA has teamed with the American Society of Neuroradiology (ASNR) and the American Society of Spine Radiology (ASSR) to create this ground truth dataset, collecting imaging data from twelve sites on six continents, including approximately 2,000 CT studies. Spine radiology specialists from the ASNR and ASSR provided expert image level annotations these studies to indicate the presence, vertebral level and location of any cervical spine fractures."
