Name: NOAA World Ocean Database (WOD)
Description: >
  The World Ocean Database (WOD) is the largest uniformly formatted, quality-controlled, publicly available historical subsurface ocean profile database. From Captain Cook's second voyage in 1772 to today's automated Argo floats, global aggregation of ocean variable information including temperature, salinity, oxygen, nutrients, and others vs. depth allow for study and understanding of the changing physical, chemical, and to some extent biological state of the World's Oceans.
