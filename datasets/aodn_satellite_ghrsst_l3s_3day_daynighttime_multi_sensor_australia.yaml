Name: Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Multi sensor - 3 day - Day and
  night time
Description: This is a multi-sensor SSTfnd L3S product for a single 72 hour period,
  derived using sea surface temperature retrievals from the VIIRS sensor on the Suomi-NPP
  satellite and JPSS series of satellites, and AVHRR sensor on the NOAA and Metop
  series of Polar-orbiting satellites. The sensors and satellite platforms contributing
  to each file are listed in the sensor and platform global attributes in the file
  header. The SSTfnd is derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the NOAA AVHRR SSTskin
  observations, and 0 degC to the Metop and VIIRS SSTsubskin observations, after rejecting
  observations with low surface wind speeds (<6 m/s by day and <2 m/s at night). The
  Multi-sensor L3S product is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant
  projected map over the region 70E to 170W, 20N to 70S. The quality level for each
  pixel was remapped using the original ACSPO VIIRS and AVHRR L3U quality levels and
  Sensor Specific Error Statistics (SSES), as described in Griffin et al. (2017) Appendix
  at http://imos.org.au/facilities/srs/sstproducts/sstdata0/sstdata-references/, before
  compositing single swaths from the sensors. Each grid cell contains the 72 hour
  average of all the highest available quality SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted
  by the area of overlap. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html
  for further information.
