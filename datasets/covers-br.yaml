    URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-music-genre-classification
Description: "CoversBR is the first large audio database with, predominantly, Brazilian\
  \ music for the tasks of Covers Song\nIdentification (CSI) and Live Song Identifications\
  \ (LSI). Due to copyright restrictions audios of\nthe songs cannot be made available,\
  \ however metadata and files of features have public access. Audio\nstreamings captured\
  \ from radio and TV channels for the live song identification task will be made\
  \ public.\nCoversBR is composed of metadata and features extracted from 102298 songs,\
  \ distributed in 26366\ngroups of covers/versions, with an average of 3.88 versions\
  \ per group. The entire collection adds up to a total of\napproximately 7070 hours\
  \ and the average song length is 240 seconds (4 minutes).\n  \n"
