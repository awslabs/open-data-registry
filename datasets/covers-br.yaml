Description: |
  CoversBR is the first large audio database with, predominantly, Brazilian music for the tasks of Covers Song
  Identification (CSI) and Live Song Identifications (LSI). Due to copyright restrictions audios of
  the songs cannot be made available, however metadata and files of features have public access. Audio
  streamings captured from radio and TV channels for the live song identification task will be made public.
  CoversBR is composed of metadata and features extracted from 102298 songs, distributed in 26366
  groups of covers/versions, with an average of 3.88 versions per group. The entire collection adds up to a total of
  approximately 7070 hours and the average song length is 240 seconds (4 minutes).
