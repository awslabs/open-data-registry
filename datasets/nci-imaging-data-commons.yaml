Description: "[Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov)\
  \  is a repository within the \n[Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov)\
  \ that manages imaging data \nand enables its integration with the other components\
  \ of CRDC. \n\nIDC hosts a growing number of imaging collections that are contributed\
  \ \nby either funded US National Cancer Institute (NCI)  data collection \nactivities,\
  \ or by the individual researchers.\n\nImage data hosted by IDC is stored in DICOM\
  \  format. \n"
