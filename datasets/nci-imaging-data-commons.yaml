Description: |
  [Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov)  is a repository within the 
  [Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov) that manages imaging data 
  and enables its integration with the other components of CRDC. 

  IDC hosts a growing number of imaging collections that are contributed 
  by either funded US National Cancer Institute (NCI)  data collection 
  activities, or by the individual researchers.

  Image data hosted by IDC is stored in DICOM  format.
