  Description: "The [NOAA Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) Network\
    \ (NCN)](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/), managed by NOAA/National Geodetic Survey\
    \ ([NGS](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/)), provide Global Navigation Satellite System\
    \ (GNSS) data, supporting three dimensional positioning, meteorology, space weather,\
    \ and geophysical applications throughout the United States. The NCN is a multi-purpose,\
    \ multi-agency cooperative endeavor, combining the efforts of hundreds of government,\
    \ academic, and private organizations. The stations are independently owned and\
    \ operated. Each agency shares their GNSS/GPS carrier phase and code range measurements\
    \ and station metadata with NGS, which are analyzed and distributed free of charge.\n\
    NGS provides access to all NCN data collected since 9 February (040) 1994.\n-\

    \    - **RINEX**: The GPS/GNSS data collected at NCN stations are made available\
    \ to the public by NGS in Receiver INdependent EXchange (RINEX) format. Most data\
    \ are available within 1 hour (60 minutes) from when they were recorded at the\
    \ remote site, and a few sites have a delay of 24 hours (1440 minutes).<br/>RINEX\
    \ data can be found at: *rinex/`YYYY`/`DDD`/`ssss`/*\n    - **Station logs**:\
    \ \n        - Station log files contain all the historical equipment (receiver/antenna)\
    \ used at that station, approximate location, owner and operating agency, etc..<br/>Station\
    \ log files can be found at: *station_log/`ssss`.log.txt*\n        - Historical\
    \ and current equipment information of all NCN stations, except those that are\
    \ considered IGS stations.<br/>These data can be found at: *station_log/cumulative.station.info.cors*\n\
    \    - **Published Coordinates and Velocities**: NAD83 and ITRF coordinates and\
    \ velocities of each NCN station. All published coordinates and velocities are\
    \ given for the Antenna Reference Point (ARP).<br/>Published coordinate and velocity\
    \ files can be found at: *coord/coord_`YY`/*<br/>In July 2019, NGS published [MYCS2](https://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/news/mycs2/mycs2.shtml)!\n\
    \    - **Time-series Plots**:\n        - *Short-term* plots show the repeatability\
    \ of a site for the last 90-days with respect to the current published position,\
    \ corrected for the effect of the published velocity. These plots are updated\
    \ daily.<br/>Short-term plots can be found at: */Plots/`ssss`_`YY`.short.png*\n\
    \        - *Long-term* plots show the show weekly residual positions with respect\
    \ to the current published coordinates from our stacked solution. Newer sites\
    \ may not have a long-term plot if they were added after our Multi-year Solution\
    \ Processing campaign.<br/>Long-term plots can be found at: */Plots/Longterm/`ssss`_`YY`.long.png*\n\
