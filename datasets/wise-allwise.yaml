Name: "AllWISE Data | Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)"
Description: The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was a NASA Medium Explorer satellite in low-Earth orbit that conducted an all-sky astronomical imaging survey over four infrared bands from 2010-2011. The AllWISE Data Release combines data from all cryogenic and post-cryogenic survey phases and provides a comprehensive view of the mid-infrared sky. The Images Atlas includes 18,240 FITS image sets at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns. The Source Catalog contains position, apparent motion, and flux information for over 747 million objects detected on the Atlas Images.

Resources:
  - Description: The AllWISE Images Atlas includes 18,240 4-band (3.4, 4.6, 12, 22 microns) calibrated 1.56 deg x1.56 deg FITS images, depth-of-coverage and noise maps, and image metadata produced by coadding nearly 7.9 million single-exposure images from all survey phases. The AllWISE Source Catalog contains accurate positions, apparent motion measurements, four-band fluxes and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected on the deep, coadded Atlas Images. It is available in Apache Parquet, partitioned by HEALPix order 5. Additional presentations of this data may be added when available.
