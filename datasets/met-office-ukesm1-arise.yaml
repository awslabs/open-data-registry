Name: Met Office UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) ARISE-SAI geoengineering experiment data
Description: Data from the UK Earth System Model (UKESM1) ARISE-SAI experiment. The UKESM1 ARISE-SAI experiment explores the impacts of geoengineering via the injection of sulphur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere in order to keep global mean surface air temperature near 1.5 C above the pre-industrial climate. Data includes a five member ensemble of simulations with SO2 injection plus a five member ensemble of SSP2-4.5 simulations from CMIP6 to serve as a reference data set
