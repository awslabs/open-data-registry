Name: Ocean Radar - Coffs Harbour site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: "The Coffs Harbour (COF) HF ocean radar site is located near the point\
  \ at which the East Australian Current (EAC) begins to separate from the coast.\
  \  Here the EAC is at its narrowest and swiftest: to the north it is forming from\
  \ the westwards subtropical jet, and to the south it forms eddies and eventually\
  \ the warm water moves eastwards across the Tasman Sea, forming a front with the\
  \ cold water of the Southern Ocean.  \n\nThe connection between coastal and continental\
  \ shelf waters is fundamental to the understanding of the anthropogenic impact on\
  \ the coastal ocean and the role of the ocean in mitigating urban marine water quality.\
  \ The oceans off Eastern Australia and in particular in the region of New South\
  \ Wales have a complex circulation structure, and are strongly connected with other\
  \ regional seas and currents. \n\nThe East Australia Current (EAC) flows from tropical\
  \ regions southward along the NSW continental slope, bringing tropical biota southward.\
  \ These current structures provide strong physical and biological connectivity,\
  \ allowing substantial transport and dispersion of biota between regions, and influencing\
  \ the transport and upwelling of nutrients, which are fundamental to biological\
  \ productivity.  \n\nThe COF HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element\
  \ receive arrays located at Red Rock (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) to the north of Coffs\
  \ Harbour and North Nambucca (-24.111 S, 152.713 E) to the south.  The area of focus\
  \ is off Coffs Harbour where IMOS and the NSW government have mooring sites.  These\
  \ radars operate at a frequency of 13.920 MHz, with a bandwidth of 100 KHz and a\
  \ maximum range of 100 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are\
  \ measured.  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant\
  \ wave height can be calculated."
