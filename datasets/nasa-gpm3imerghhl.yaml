  at GES DISC
Description: |- 
  Version 07B is the current version of the IMERG data sets. Older versions
  will no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated
  Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is the unified U.S. algorithm that provides
  the multi-satellite precipitation product for the U.S. GPM team.\n\nThe precipitation
  estimates from the various precipitation-relevant satellite passive microwave (PMW)
  sensors comprising the GPM constellation are computed using the 2021 version of
  the Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF2021), then gridded, intercalibrated to the
  GPM Combined Ku Radar-Radiometer Algorithm (CORRA) product, and merged into half-hourly
  0.1°x0.1° (roughly 10x10 km) fields. Note that CORRA is adjusted to the monthly
  Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Satellite-Gauge (SG) product over
  high-latitude ocean to correct known biases.\n\nThe half-hourly intercalibrated
  merged PMW estimates are then input to both a Morphing-Kalman Filter (KF) Lagrangian
  time interpolation scheme based on work by the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and
  the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural
  Networks (PERSIANN) Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR) re-calibration scheme. In
  parallel, CPC assembles the zenith-angle-corrected, intercalibrated merged geo-IR
  fields and forwards them to PPS for input to the PERSIANN-CCS algorithm (supported
  by an asynchronous re-calibration cycle) which are then input to the KF morphing
  (quasi-Lagrangian time interpolation) scheme.\n\nThe KF morphing (supported by an
  asynchronous KF weights updating cycle) uses the PMW and IR estimates to create
  half-hourly estimates. Motion vectors for the morphing are computed by maximizing
  the pattern correlation of successive hours within each of the precipitation (PRECTOT),
  total precipitable liquid water (TQL), and vertically integrated vapor (TQV) data
  fields provided by the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications,
  Version 2 (MERRA-2) and Goddard Earth Observing System model Version 5 (GEOS-5)
  Forward Processing (FP) for the post-real-time (Final) Run and the near-real-time
  (Early and Late) Runs, respectively. The vectors from PRECTOT are chosen if available,
  else from TQL, if available, else from TQV. The KF uses the morphed data as the
  “forecast” and the IR estimates as the “observations”, with weighting that depends
  on the time interval(s) away from the microwave overpass time. The IR becomes important
  after about ±90 minutes away from the overpass time. Variable averaging in the KF
  is accounted for in a routine (Scheme for Histogram Adjustment with Ranked Precipitation
  Estimates in the Neighborhood, or SHARPEN) that compares the local histogram of
  KF morphed precipitation to the local histogram of forward- and backward-morphed
  microwave data and the IR.\n\nThe IMERG system is run twice in near-real time:\n\n\"Early\"
  multi-satellite product ~4 hr after observation time using only forward morphing
  and\n\"Late\" multi-satellite product ~14 hr after observation time, using both
  forward and backward morphing\nand once after the monthly gauge analysis is received:\n\n\"Final\",
  satellite-gauge product ~4 months after the observation month, using both forward
  and backward morphing and including monthly gauge analyses.\n\nIn V07, the near-real-time
  Early and Late half-hourly estimates have a monthly climatological concluding calibration
  based on averaging the concluding calibrations computed in the Final, while in the
  post-real-time Final Run the multi-satellite half-hourly estimates are adjusted
  so that they sum to the Final Run monthly satellite-gauge combination. In all cases
  the output contains multiple fields that provide information on the input data,
  selected intermediate fields, and estimation quality. In general, the complete calibrated
  precipitation, precipitation, is the data field of choice for most users.\n\nPrecipitation
  phase is a diagnostic variable computed using analyses of surface temperature, humidity,
  and pressure. \n\n\n\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this
