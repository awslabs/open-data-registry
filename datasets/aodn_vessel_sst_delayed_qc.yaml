Name: Ships of Opportunity - Sea surface temperature - 1-minute average data products
Description: "The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility produces 1-minute average\
  \ data products. Observed data are 1-minute median SST values and are retrieved\
  \ from the vessel once an hour. High-resolution 1-minute median data are available\
  \ in the delayed mode approximately every 3 months, these were produced in delayed\
  \ mode using visual (manual) inspection of the quality flags after the data had\
  \ been run through the automated quality control software at the Bureau of Meteorology\
  \ The data products are produced from data from 3 ships: L'Astrolabe, Xutra Buhm\
  \ and Wana Buhm, within this sub-facility working in the Australian region, Southern\
  \ Ocean and South-East Asia. \n\nL'Astrolabe is a research vessel operating in Antarctic\
  \ and sub-Antarctic waters during the summer period (usually October through March).\
  \ 1-minute averaged SST (from the SBE 38 temperature sensor) and thermosalinograph\
  \ salinity data are logged on the vessel and manually retrieved by CMAR staff after\
  \ the voyage is completed. The data are run through the Bureau of Meteorology's\
  \ automated quality control system followed by visual inspection and adjustment,\
  \ if necessary, of the quality flags. This data stream is temporarily discontinued\
  \ (2013). An SBE 48 hull-temperature sensor installed on both the MV Xutra Bhum\
  \ and the MV Wana Buhm, produces observations of SST every 10 seconds. These data\
  \ are recorded into 1 minute median SST values on the vessel and manually retrieved\
  \ by Bureau of Meteorology staff approximately monthly. The data are run through\
  \ the Bureau of Meteorology's automated quality control system followed by visual\
  \ inspection and adjustment, if necessary, of the quality flags. Both of these data\
  \ streams have now been discontinued (April 2013)."
