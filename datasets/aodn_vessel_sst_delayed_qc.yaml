Description: "The Sea Surface Temperature (SST) sub-facility produces 1-minute average data products.\ 
  \ Observed data are 1-minute median SST values and are retrieved from the vessel once an hour.\ 
  \ High-resolution 1-minute median data are available in the delayed mode approximately\
  \ every 3 months, these were produced in delayed mode using visual (manual) inspection\
  \ of the quality flags after the data had been run through the automated quality control software\
  \ at the Bureau of Meteorology The data products are produced from data from 3 ships:\
  \ L'Astrolabe, Xutra Buhm and Wana Buhm, within this sub-facility working in the Australian region,\
  \ Southern Ocean and South-East Asia. \n\nL'Astrolabe is a research vessel operating in Antarctic\
  \ and sub-Antarctic waters during the summer period (usually October through March).\
  \ 1-minute averaged SST (from the SBE 38 temperature sensor) and thermosalinograph salinity data\
  \ are logged on the vessel and manually retrieved by CMAR staff after the voyage is completed.\
  \ The data are run through the Bureau of Meteorology's automated quality control system\
  \ followed by visual inspection and adjustment, if necessary, of the quality flags.\
  \ This data stream is temporarily discontinued (2013). An SBE 48 hull-temperature sensor\
  \ installed on both the MV Xutra Bhum and the MV Wana Buhm, produces observations of SST\
  \ every 10 seconds. These data are recorded into 1 minute median SST values on the vessel\
  \ and manually retrieved by Bureau of Meteorology staff approximately monthly.\
  \ The data are run through the Bureau of Meteorology's automated quality control system\
  \ followed by visual inspection and adjustment, if necessary, of the quality flags.\
  \ Both of these data streams have now been discontinued (April 2013)."
