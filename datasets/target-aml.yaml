Name: TARGET-AML open data
Description: |
  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) is the collaborative
  effort of a large, diverse consortium of extramural and NCI investigators. The goal of the effort
  is to accelerate molecular discoveries that drive the initiation and progression of hard-to-treat
  childhood cancers and facilitate rapid translation of those findings into the clinic.

  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that originates in the bone marrow from immature white
  blood cells known as myeloblasts. TARGET-AML project provides comprehensive molecular
  characterization to determine the genetic changes that drive the initiation and progression of
  childhood AML. The dataset contains open Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene
  Expression Quantification, miRNA-Seq Isoform Expression Quantification, and miRNA Expression
  Quantification data from Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and open data from GDC Legacy Archive.
