Name: DAILY EAR PER EQUIVALENT ENERGY RESERVOIR
Description: Stored Energy Data (EAR) on a daily basis by Equivalent Energy Reservoir (REE). This quantity represents the energy associated with the volume of 
water stored in the reservoirs that can be converted into generation in the power plant itself and in all power plants downstream of the cascade. The magnitude of EAR considers the level verified in the reservoirs on the reference date. 
The maximum EAR magnitude is the storage capacity if all reservoirs were full
