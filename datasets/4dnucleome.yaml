Description: "The goal of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund\u2019\
  s 4D Nucleome (4DN) program\nis to study the three-dimensional organization of the\
  \ nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension).\nThe nucleus of a cell contains\
  \ DNA, the genetic \u201Cblueprint\u201D that encodes all of the genes a living\n\
  organism uses to produce proteins needed to carry out life-sustaining cellular functions.\
  \ Understanding\nthe conformation of the nuclear DNA and how it is maintained or\
  \ changes in response to environmental\nand cellular cues over time will provide\
  \ insights into basic biology as well as aspects of human\nhealth and disease. The\
  \ 4DN is an international consortium of researchers who generate data that\ninclude\
  \ results from a variety of genomics and imaging assays with a focus on, but not\
  \ exclusive to,\nthose that demonstrate close contact between chromatin loci that\
  \ are non-adjacent on the linear DNA\nsequence of chromosomes. Additional assays\
  \ probe the nuclear landscape in the context of interactions\nof chromatin with\
  \ specific proteins, RNAs and epigenetic changes.\n"
