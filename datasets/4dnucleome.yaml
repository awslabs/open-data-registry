Name: 4D Nucleome (4DN)
Description: |
  The goal of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Fund’s 4D Nucleome (4DN) program
  is to study the three-dimensional organization of the nucleus in space and time (the 4th dimension).
  The nucleus of a cell contains DNA, the genetic “blueprint” that encodes all of the genes a living
  organism uses to produce proteins needed to carry out life-sustaining cellular functions. Understanding
  the conformation of the nuclear DNA and how it is maintained or changes in response to environmental
  and cellular cues over time will provide insights into basic biology as well as aspects of human
  health and disease. The 4DN is an international consortium of researchers who generate data that
  include results from a variety of genomics and imaging assays with a focus on, but not exclusive to,
  those that demonstrate close contact between chromatin loci that are non-adjacent on the linear DNA
  sequence of chromosomes. Additional assays probe the nuclear landscape in the context of interactions
  of chromatin with specific proteins, RNAs and epigenetic changes.
