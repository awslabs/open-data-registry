  EPA Hourly Prognostic Meteorological Data 
Description: >-
  The data are hourly outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model
  generated by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Air Quality
  Assessment Division, Air Quality Modeling Group. These data were generated at a 12-km
  resolution over the Continental United States (12US), beginning for the year 2021 and
  continuing annually through 2023. These files are intended for use in a broad range of 
  air quality applications, but specifically may be used in dispersion modeling applications
  that would benefit from the use of the Mesoscale Model Interface (MMIF) tool 
  (https://www.epa.gov/scram/air-quality-dispersion-modeling-related-model-support-programs#mmif)
  which translates prognostic meteorological data into formats suitable for use with AERMOD,
  CALPUFF, or SCICHEM. The individual files are less than 1GB in size, which allows for
  the use of the MMIF tool in a Windows environment. These data are anticipated to be updated
  annually so the 3 most-recent years are available for use. Additionally, model-observation
  paired files are included to aid in the performance evaluation that is necessary for use
  of these data in regulatory applications per Appendix W to 40 CFR Part 51.

  - Description: >-
      The WRF output are stored as uncompressed netcdf/hdf5 formatted files in 
      directories corresponding to the specific years of interest. The model-obs
      paired files are stored as comma-delimited files in the year-specific
      directories.
