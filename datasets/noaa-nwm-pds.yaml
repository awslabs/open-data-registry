Description: "The National Water Model (NWM) is a water resources model that simulates\
  \ and forecasts water\nbudget variables, including snowpack, evapotranspiration,\
  \ soil moisture and streamflow, over\nthe entire continental United States (CONUS).\
  \ The model, launched in August 2016, is designed\nto improve the ability of NOAA\
  \ to meet the needs of its stakeholders (forecasters, emergency\nmanagers, reservoir\
  \ operators, first responders, recreationists, farmers, barge operators, and\necosystem\
  \ and floodplain managers) by providing expanded accuracy, detail, and frequency\
  \ of water\ninformation. It is operated by NOAA\u2019s Office of Water Prediction.\
  \ This bucket contains a four-week\nrollover of the Short Range Forecast model output\
  \ and the corresponding forcing data for the\nmodel. The model is forced with meteorological\
  \ data from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)\nand the Rapid Refresh (RAP)\
  \ models. The Short Range Forecast configuration cycles hourly and produces\nhourly\
  \ deterministic forecasts of streamflow and hydrologic states out to 18 hours.\n"
