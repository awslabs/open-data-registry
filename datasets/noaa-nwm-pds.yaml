Name: NOAA National Water Model Short-Range Forecast
Description: |
  The National Water Model (NWM) is a water resources model that simulates and forecasts water
  budget variables, including snowpack, evapotranspiration, soil moisture and streamflow, over
  the entire continental United States (CONUS). The model, launched in August 2016, is designed
  to improve the ability of NOAA to meet the needs of its stakeholders (forecasters, emergency
  managers, reservoir operators, first responders, recreationists, farmers, barge operators, and
  ecosystem and floodplain managers) by providing expanded accuracy, detail, and frequency of water
  information. It is operated by NOAA’s Office of Water Prediction. This bucket contains a four-week
  rollover of the Short Range Forecast model output and the corresponding forcing data for the
  model. The model is forced with meteorological data from the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR)
  and the Rapid Refresh (RAP) models. The Short Range Forecast configuration cycles hourly and produces
  hourly deterministic forecasts of streamflow and hydrologic states out to 18 hours.
