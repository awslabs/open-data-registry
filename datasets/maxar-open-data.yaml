Name: Maxar Open Data Program
Description: |
  Pre and post event high-resolution satellite imagery in support of emergency planning, risk assessment, 
  monitoring of staging areas and emergency response, damage assessment, and recovery. These images are generated
  using the [Maxar ARD](https://ard.maxar.com/docs) pipeline, tiled on an organized grid in analysis-ready
  cloud-optimized formats.
