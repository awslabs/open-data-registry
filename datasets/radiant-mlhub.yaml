Name: Radiant MLHub
Description: Radiant MLHub is an open library for geospatial training data that hosts datasets generated by [Radiant Earth Foundation](https://www.radiant.earth/)'s team as well as other training data catalogs contributed by Radiant Earthâ€™s partners. Radiant MLHub is open to anyone to access, store, register and/or share their training datasets for high-quality Earth observations. All of the training datasets are stored using a [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) compliant catalog and exposed through a common API. Training datasets include pairs of imagery and labels for different types of machine learning problems including image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Labels are generated from ground reference data and/or image annotation.
