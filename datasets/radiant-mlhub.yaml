Description: "Radiant MLHub is an open library for geospatial training data that hosts\
  \ datasets generated by [Radiant Earth Foundation](https://www.radiant.earth/)'s\
  \ team as well as other training data catalogs contributed by Radiant Earth\u2019\
  s partners. Radiant MLHub is open to anyone to access, store, register and/or share\
  \ their training datasets for high-quality Earth observations. All of the training\
  \ datasets are stored using a [SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/)\
  \ compliant catalog and exposed through a common API. Training datasets include\
  \ pairs of imagery and labels for different types of machine learning problems including\
  \ image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Labels are\
  \ generated from ground reference data and/or image annotation."
Documentation: http://docs.mlhub.earth/
License: Access to Radiant MLHub data is free for everyone. Each dataset has its own
  license (usually CC-BY or CC-BY-SA). View [Terms of Service](https://www.radiant.earth/terms/).
