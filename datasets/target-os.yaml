Name: TARGET-OS open data
Description: |
  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) is the collaborative
  effort of a large, diverse consortium of extramural and NCI investigators. The goal of the effort
  is to accelerate molecular discoveries that drive the initiation and progression of hard-to-treat
  childhood cancers and facilitate rapid translation of those findings into the clinic.

  Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of bone cancer in children and adolescents. TARGET-OS
  project provides comprehensive molecular characterization to determine the genetic changes that
  drive the initiation and progression of childhood OS. The dataset contains open Clinical
  Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data from Genomic Data
  Commons (GDC), and open data from GDC Legacy Archive.
