Name: Fruit-bat vocalizations annotated with varying context and vocal ontogenesis
Description: "Database of Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations, continuously recorded in lab settings\
\ in several groups simultaneously for more than a year.\
\ The dataset includes almost 300,000 social vocalizations, a few seconds each,\ 
\ representing the complete vocal repertoire used by the bats in the experiment period.\ 
\ Around 90,000 vocalizations are annotated with the identity of the individuals involved in the vocal interactions, their behaviours and the context.\
\ Data include the complete vocal ontogeny of pups, from birth to adulthood, in different conditions (e.g., isolated or in a group).\
\ The original dataset is available in archives published in:\
\ Prat, Yosef; Taub, Mor; Pratt, Ester; Yovel, Yossi (2017). An annotated dataset of Egyptian fruit bat vocalizations across varying contexts and during vocal ontogeny. figshare. Collection. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.3666502.v2\ 
\ The dataset is here copied and extended with data pre-processing derivatives, to facilitate research involving AI on large bioacoustics datasets"
