Name: recount3
Description: |
    recount3 is an online resource consisting of RNA-seq gene, exon, and exon-exon junction counts as well as coverage bigWig files for 8,679 and 10,088 different studies for human and mouse respectively. It is the third generation of the ReCount project and part of recount.bio. recount2 is also included for historical purposes. The pipeline used to generate the data in recount3 (but not recount2) is available [here](https://github.com/langmead-lab/monorail-external).
