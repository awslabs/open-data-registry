Name:  RSNA Pulmonary Embolism Detection
Description: "RSNA assembled this dataset in 2020 for the RSNA STR Pulmonary Embolism Detection AI Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-str-pulmonary-embolism-detection/). With more than 12,000 CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) studies contributed by five international research centers, it is the largest publicly available annotated PE dataset. RSNA collaborated with the Society of Thoracic Radiology to recruit more than 80 expert thoracic radiologists who labeled the dataset with detailed clinical annotations."
