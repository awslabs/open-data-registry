Name: Open Human Genome Library
Description: >
  The Open Human Genome Library (OpenHGL) is a collection of high-quality
  *de novo* human assemblies that are publicly available in genomic databases
  (e.g. NCBI and CNCB) or from individual research papers. It provides
  consistent naming and uniform formats across datasets, supporting efficient
  subsequence retrieval and approximate string search.
