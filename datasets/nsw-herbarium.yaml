Name: National Herbarium of NSW
Description: |
  The National Herbarium of New South Wales is one of the most significant scientific, cultural and historical botanical resources in the Southern hemisphere. The 1.43 million preserved plant specimens have been captured as high-resolution images and the biodiversity metadata associated with each of the images captured in digital form. Botanical specimens date from year 1770 to today, and form voucher collections that document the distribution and diversity of the world's flora through time, particularly that of NSW, Austalia and the Pacific.

  The data is used in biodiversity assessment, systematic botanical research, ecosystem conservation and policy development. The data is used by scientists, students and the public.
