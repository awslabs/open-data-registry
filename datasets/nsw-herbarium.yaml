Description: 'The National Herbarium of New South Wales is one of the most significant
  scientific, cultural and historical botanical resources in the Southern hemisphere.
  The 1.43 million preserved plant specimens have been captured as high-resolution
  images and the biodiversity metadata associated with each of the images captured
  in digital form. Botanical specimens date from year 1770 to today, and form voucher
  collections that document the distribution and diversity of the world''s flora through
  time, particularly that of NSW, Austalia and the Pacific.


  The data is used in biodiversity assessment, systematic botanical research, ecosystem
  conservation and policy development. The data is used by scientists, students and
  the public.
