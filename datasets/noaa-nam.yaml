    ', Description: "The North American Mesoscale Forecast System (NAM) is one of\
    \ the National Centers For Environmental Prediction\u2019s (NCEP) major models\
    \ for producing weather forecasts. NAM generates multiple grids (or domains) of\
    \ weather forecasts over the North American continent at various horizontal resolutions.\
    \ Each grid contains data for dozens of weather parameters, including temperature,\
    \ precipitation, lightning, and turbulent kinetic energy. NAM uses additional\
    \ numerical weather models to generate high-resolution forecasts over fixed regions,\
    \ and occasionally to follow significant weather events like hurricanes.", Documentation: 'https://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/emc/pages/numerical_forecast_systems/nam.php,
