Name: MISR Level 1B2 Ellipsoid Data V004
Description: "MI1B2E_004 is the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) Level
  1B2 Ellipsoid Data Version 4 product. It contains Ellipsoid-projected Top-of-Atmosphere
  (TOA) Radiance, resampled at the surface and topographically corrected, as well
  as geometrically corrected by PGE22. Data collection for this product is ongoing.\r\n\r\nMISR
  itself is an instrument designed to view Earth with cameras pointed in 9 different
  directions. As the instrument flies overhead, each piece of Earth's surface below
  is successively imaged by all 9 cameras, in each of 4 wavelengths (blue, green,
  red, and near-infrared). The goal of MISR is to improve our understanding of the
  affects of sunlight on Earth, as well as distinguish different types of clouds,
  particles and surfaces. Specifically, MISR monitors the monthly, seasonal, and long-term
  trends in three areas: 1) amount and type of atmospheric particles (aerosols), including
  those formed by natural sources and by human activities; 2) amounts, types, and
  heights of clouds, and 3) distribution of land surface cover, including vegetation
  canopy structure.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data:
