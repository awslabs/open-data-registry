Name: EarthDEM
Description:  EarthDEM - 2m GSD Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and mosaics from 2002 to the present. The EarthDEM project seeks to fill the need for high-resolution time-series elevation data in non-polar regions. The time-dependent nature of the strip DEM files allows users to perform change detection analysis and to compare observations of topography data acquired in different seasons or years. The mosaic DEM tiles are assembled from multiple strip DEMs with the intention of providing a more consistent and comprehensive product over large areas. EarthDEM data is constructed from in-track and cross-track high-resolution (~0.5 meter) imagery acquired by the Maxar constellation of optical imaging satellites. Only a portion of the worldwide EarthDEM dataset is available publicly. Federally-funded researchers may access the entire dataset via NASA CSDA's Smallsat Data Explorer (see Data at Work section).
