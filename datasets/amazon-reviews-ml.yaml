Description: We present a collection of Amazon reviews specifically designed to aid
  research in multilingual text classification. The dataset contains reviews in English,
  Japanese, German, French, Chinese and Spanish, collected between November 1, 2015
  and November 1, 2019. Each record in the dataset contains the review text, the review
  title, the star rating, an anonymized reviewer ID, an anonymized product ID and
  the coarse-grained product category (e.g. 'books', 'appliances', etc.)
