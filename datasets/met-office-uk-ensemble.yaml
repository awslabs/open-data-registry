Name: Met Office Global and Regional Ensemble Prediction System - UK (MOGREPS-UK) on a 30-day rolling archive
Description: The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified Model, 
 the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office runs several configurations of 
 the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite. 

 The regional ensemble (MOGREPS-UK) produces forecasts for an area covering the UK for the next five days. 

 In the UK ensemble the model parameters (temperature, pressure, wind, humidity, etc.) are forecast at grid points 
 separated by about 2.2 km, and the model has 70 vertical levels. 

 The UK ensemble covers a limited area, so the global ensemble provides information on the weather entering the UK model domain through the boundaries. 

 Please note this is a public beta and therefore a non-operational service.
