Description: "The SOHO/LASCO data set (prepared for the challenge hosted in Topcoder)\
  \ provided here comes from the instrument\u2019s C2 telescope and comprises approximately\
  \ 36,000 images spread across 2,950 comet observations. The human eye is a very\
  \ sensitive tool and it is the only tool currently used to reliably detect new comets\
  \ in SOHO data - particularly comets that are very faint and embedded in the instrument\
  \ background noise. Bright comets can be easily detected in the LASCO data by relatively\
  \ simple automated algorithms, but the majority of comets observed by the instrument\
  \ are extremely faint, noise-level observations. Comets in SOHO/LASCO data are dynamic\
  \ and morphologically diverse objects, and thus computationally highly complex to\
  \ detect and track.\n"
