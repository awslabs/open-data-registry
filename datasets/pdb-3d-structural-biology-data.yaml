Name: Protein Data Bank 3D Structural Biology Data
Description: >
  The "Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive" was established in 1971 as the first open-access digital data archive in biology. It is a collection of three-dimensional (3D) structures of biological macromolecules (i.e., proteins, DNA, and RNA) and their complexes with one another and various small-molecule ligands (e.g., US FDA approved drugs, enzyme co-factors). For each structure, multiple data files contain information about the 3D atomic coordinates, sequences of biological macromolecules, information about any small molecules/ligands present in the structure, details about the experiment, authors and publication information, and experimental data. A single PDB structure will have multiple associated files, including raw experimental data and validation reports. Additional content stored in the archive include documentation, summary reports, and software (among others).

  The PDB is a jointly-managed core archive of the Worldwide Protein Data Bank partnership, which includes RCSB Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB, rcsb.org); Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe, pdbe.org); Protein Data Bank Japan (PDBj, pdbj.org); Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB, emdb-empiar.org); and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB, bmrb.io). The RCSB PDB serves as the wwPDB-designated archive keeper for the PDB core archive.
