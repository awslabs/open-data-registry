Name: Prefeitura Municipal de São Paulo (PMSP) LiDAR Point Cloud
Description: The objective of the Mapa 3D Digital da Cidade (M3DC) of the São Paulo City Hall is to publish LiDAR point cloud data. The initial data was acquired in 2017 by aerial surveying and future data will be added. This publicly accessible dataset is provided in the [Entwine Point Tiles](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html) format as a lossless octree, full density, based on [LASzip](https://laszip.org) (LAZ) encoding.
