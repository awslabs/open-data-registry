Name: ChEMBL
Description: ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the translation of genomic information into effective new drugs. This representation of ChEMBL is stored in Parquet format and most easily utilized through Amazon Athena. Follow the documentation for install instructions (< 2 minute install). New ChEMBL releases occur sporadically; the most up to date information on ChEMBL releases can be found [here](https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/downloads).
