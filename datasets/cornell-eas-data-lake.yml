Name: 'Cornell EAS Data Lake'
Description: >
  Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University has created a public data
  lake of climate data. The data is stored in columnar storage formats (ORC) to
  make it straightforward to query using standard tools like Amazon
  Athena or Apache Spark. The data itself is originally intended to be used for
  building decision support tools for farmers and digital agriculture. The first
  dataset is the historical NDFD / NDGD data distributed by NCEP / NOAA / NWS.
