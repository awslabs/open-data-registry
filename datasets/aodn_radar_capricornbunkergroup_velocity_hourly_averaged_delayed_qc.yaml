Name: Ocean Radar - Capricorn bunker group site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: "The Capricorn Bunker Group site is in the southern region  of the Great\
  \ Barrier Reef Marine Park World Heritage Area (GBR).  The HF ocean radar coverage\
  \ is from the coast to beyond the edge of the continental shelf.  This is an area\
  \ where the East Australian Current (EAC) meanders as it moves south from the Swain\
  \ Reefs and loses touch with the western land boundary.  The area is dynamic with\
  \ warm EAC water recirculating and being wind-driven northwards along the coast\
  \ inside the GBR lagoon.  The recirculating warm water contrasts with the upwelling\
  \ tendency of the parts of the EAC which continue to move southwards.  The CBG radar\
  \ is ideally placed to follow filaments of different water types and to investigate\
  \ their impacts on coral reefs and fisheries.  \n\nApplications of the CBG radar\
  \ data are in the frequency and location of regional upwelling that fuels productivity,\
  \ and in the connectivity between reefs and islands.  At the central point of the\
  \ CBG area of coverage is the  Heron Island Research Station which hosts many coral\
  \ reef and ecology research programs.  The data will also be useful for validation\
  \ of the operational Bluelink model, and the embedded higher resolution Whole-of-Reef\
  \ model.   \n\nThe CBG HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 12-element\
  \ receive arrays located at Tannum Sands (-23.942 S, 151.371 E) and Lady Elliot\
  \ Island (-24.111 S, 152.713 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 8.348 MHz,\
  \ with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution\
  \ of 4.5 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured. \
  \ Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height\
  \ can be calculated.  \n\nThe capital funding for this system was provided originally\
  \ as an ARC LEIF Grant, assisted by contributions from James Cook University, The\
  \ University of Queensland, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\
  \ and the Australian Institute of Marine Science.\n\nThis site was decommissioned\
  \ in April 2017."
