Name: 'Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1)'
Description: 'Euclid launched in July 2023 as a European Space Agency (ESA) mission with involvement by NASA. The primary science goals of Euclid are to better understand the composition and evolution of the dark Universe. The Euclid mission will provide space-based imaging and spectroscopy as well as supporting ground-based imaging to achieve these primary goals. These data will be archived by multiple global repositories, including IRSA, where they will support transformational work in many areas of astrophysics. Euclid Quick Release 1 (Q1) consists of ~30 TB of imaging, spectroscopy, and catalogs covering four non-contiguous fields: Euclid Deep Field North (22.9 sq deg), Euclid Deep Field Fornax (12.1 sq deg), Euclid Deep Field South (28.1 sq deg), and LDN1641.'
