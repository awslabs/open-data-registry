Name: COVID-19 Molecular Structure and Therapeutics Hub
Description: |
  Aggregating critical information to accelerate drug discovery for the molecular modeling and simulation community.
  A community-driven data repository and curation service for molecular structures, models, therapeutics, and
  simulations related to computational research related to therapeutic opportunities for COVID-19
  (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus).

  - Description: |
      Data storage of for the MolSSI and BioExcel COVID-19 Hub. Includes atomistic structures (often as PDB),
      refined models (as PDB or higher resolution molecular file types), simulations (file types a function of the
      simulation program, usually compressed as zip or tarball), drug databases of conformers and tautomers
      (primarily compressed mol2 files), and any additional supporting files necessary to reproduce or process the data
      included in the the compressed package (e.g. simulation inputs).
