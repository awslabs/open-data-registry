Description: 'Aggregating critical information to accelerate drug discovery for the
  molecular modeling and simulation community.

  A community-driven data repository and curation service for molecular structures,
  models, therapeutics, and

  simulations related to computational research related to therapeutic opportunities
  for COVID-19

  (caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus).

  Description: 'Data storage of for the MolSSI and BioExcel COVID-19 Hub. Includes
    atomistic structures (often as PDB),

    refined models (as PDB or higher resolution molecular file types), simulations
    (file types a function of the

    simulation program, usually compressed as zip or tarball), drug databases of conformers
    and tautomers

    (primarily compressed mol2 files), and any additional supporting files necessary
    to reproduce or process the data

    included in the the compressed package (e.g. simulation inputs).
