Name: Open Targets
Description: This a Parquet representation of the Open Targets Platform's [2020-06 export](https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org) is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, genomics, and chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.
