Description: This a parquet representation of the The Open Targets Platform's (https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data) exports. The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org) is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, omics and chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.
