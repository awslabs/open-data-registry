Name: National Mooring Network - CTD profiles
Description: This collection includes conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) profiles
  obtained at the National Reference Stations (NRS) as part of the water sampling
  program. The instruments used also measure dissolved oxygen, fluorescence, and turbidity.
  The collection also includes practical salinity, water density and artificial chlorophyll
  concentration, as computed from the measured properties. The data are processed
  in delayed mode, with automated quality control applied. The National Reference
  Station network is designed to provide baseline information, at timescales relevant
  to human response, that is required to understand how large-scale, long-term change
  and variability in the global ocean are affecting the ecosystems of Australia's
  coastal seas. The stations are operated by the Australian National Moorings Network
  (ANMN), a facility of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).
