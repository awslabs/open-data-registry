Name: Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - Himawari-8 -
  1 day - Night time
Description: "This is a regional GHRSST level 3 collated (L3C) dataset on 0.02-degree\
  \ rectangular grid over the Australasian domain (70E to 190E, 70S to 20N) based\
  \ on retrievals from the AHI imager on board Himawari-8 satellite. The Bureau of\
  \ Meteorology (Bureau) produces Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) satellite\
  \ SST products in the International Group for High Resolution SST (GHRSST) GDS2\
  \ file formats for Himawari-8 in real time and delayed mode. This product is composed\
  \ of reprocessed multi-swath SSTskin retrievals obtained from compositing IMOS Himawari-8\
  \ hourly L3C files over the night (before dawn).  \nEvery 10 minutes, the Himawari-8\
  \ full disk is processed to retrieve SSTs by using the Radiative Transfer Model\
  \ (RTTOV12.3) and Bayesian cloud clearing method based on the ESA CCI SST code developed\
  \ at the University of Reading. The hourly product on native grid is then produced\
  \ by compositing over multiple swaths for the previous 1 hour. Further, L3C-01day\
  \ SST fields on native grid are obtained by selecting the highest quality data from\
  \ the hourly SST records with priority being given to the value the closest in time\
  \ to the product nominal hour.  The L3C-1day night product on native grid is then\
  \ remapped over the 0.02-degree IMOS grid to compose IMOS L3C-1day night product\
  \ (Govekar et al., 2021,  https://www.foo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Govekar_FOO_2021.pdf).\
  \   The product format is compliant with the GHRSST Data Specification (GDS) version\
