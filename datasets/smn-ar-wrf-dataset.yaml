Description: "The Servicio Meteorol\xF3gico Nacional de Argentina (SMN-Arg), the National\
  \ Meteorological Service of Argentina, shares its deterministic forecasts generated\
  \ with WRF 4.0 (Weather and Research Forecasting) initialized at 00 and 12 UTC every\
  \ day.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis forecast includes some key hourly surface variables \u2013\
  2 m temperature, 2 m relative humidity, 10 m wind magnitude and direction, and precipitation\u2013\
  , along with other daily variables, minimum and maximum temperature.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
  The forecast covers Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and parts of Bolivia and\
  \ Brazil  in a Lambert conformal projection, with 4 km horizontal resolution. The\
  \ maximum lead time is 72 hours. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nForecasts are initialized with\
  \ the NCEP-NOAA Global Forecast Systems analysis and forecasts ([GFS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/weather-climate-models/global-forecast)).\n"
