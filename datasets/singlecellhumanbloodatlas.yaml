Name: Single-Cell Atlas of Human Blood During Healthy Aging
Description: Comprehensive, large-scale single-cell profiling of healthy human blood at different ages is one of the critical pending tasks required to establish a framework for systematic understanding of human aging. Here, using single-cell RNA/TCR/BCR-seq with protein feature barcoding (20 antibodies), we profiled 317 samples from 166 healthy individuals aged 25 to 85 years old drawn over 3-year period. Dataset spanning ~2 million cells describes 50 subpopulations of blood immune cells, with 14 subpopulations changing with age, including a novel NKG2C+ CD8 Tcm population that decreases with age. We describe age-associated accumulation of Th2 and HLA-DR+ memory CD4 T cells, CCR4+ CD8 Tcm cells and GZMK+ CD8 Tem cells. We validate key findings using 30-plex spectral cytometry panel. We characterize patterns of antigen receptor clonality across subpopulations of T and B cells and describe their age-dependence. Our work provides novel insights into healthy human aging and unique annotated resource of unprecedented depth.
