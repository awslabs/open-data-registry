Name: Digital Earth Pacific Seagrass Extent
Description: |
  Seagrass extents provide estimates of seagrass area over time. These datasets complement global models of marine benthic habitats, including the Allen Coral Atlas, by providing regional-scale coverage for Pacific Island countries and territories. While this dataset has a relatively lower spatial resolution than the Allen Coral Atlas, it offers greater temporal coverage, allowing for ongoing monitoring. The layers include seagrass extents, conservative estimates at a 60% probability threshold against nine other classes, seagrass probability visualised as a continuum and broader coastal marine habitats. Note that this product is still undergoing validation, which will be completed in three stages. These include a) an 80-20 split validation and confusion matrix testing, b) validation from separate geotagged observation points collected through an independent third-party scientific organisation and c) through consultation with counterparts from Pacific Island countries and territories government and research institutes.
