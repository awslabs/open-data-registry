Description: "The research vessels (RV Cape Ferguson and RV Solander) of the Australian\
  \ Institute of Marine Science (AIMS) routinely record along-track (underway) measurements\
  \ of near-surface water temperature, salinity, chlorophyll (fluorescence) and turbidity\
  \ (NTU) during scientific operations in the tropical waters of northern Australia,\
  \ particularly the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). All data records include sampling time\
  \ (UTC), position (Latitude, Longitude) and water depth (under keel). \n\nData are\
  \ recorded at 10 second intervals. Data are measured with a Seabird SBE38 thermometer,\
  \ Seabird SBE21 thermosalinograph and Wetlabs ECO-FLNTU-RT (optical sensor for chlorophyll\
  \ fluorescence and turbidity). The turbidity data (NTU) are currently regarded as\
  \ provisional in the absence of local validation due to intermittent bubble contamination.\
  \ The sampling intakes are located at depths of 1.9m (RV Cape Ferguson) and 2.5m\
  \ (RV Solander).\n\nThe data is used to inform spatial patchiness of these variables\
  \ and for ongoing validation of satellite ocean temperature and ocean colour products.\n\
  \nThe IMOS Ships of Opportunity, Sensors on Tropical Research Vessels sub-Facility\
  \ was discontinued in June 2022. Sea surface temperature data collected by Australian\
  \ Institute of Marine Science research vessels continues to be provided via the\
  \ IMOS Ships of Opportunity, Sea Surface Temperature Sensors for Australian Vessels\
  \ sub-Facility records on the AODN Portal. The near real time sea surface temperature\
  \ data are quality controlled by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology and uploaded\
  \ onto the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) for global dissemination to be\
  \ used in real time sea surface temperature analyses and climate data records. Access\
  \ to the additional data collected by the AIMS research vessels, is provided on\
  \ the AIMS data repository here: https://apps.aims.gov.au/metadata/view/8af21108-c535-43bf-8dab-c1f45a26088c."
