Description: 'Global fixed broadband and mobile (cellular) network performance, allocated
  to zoom level 16 web mercator tiles (approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters
  at the equator). Data is provided in both Shapefile format as well as Apache Parquet
  with geometries represented in Well Known Text (WKT) projected in EPSG:4326. Download
  speed, upload speed, and latency are collected via the Speedtest by Ookla applications
  for Android and iOS and averaged for each tile. Measurements are filtered to results
  containing GPS-quality location accuracy.
