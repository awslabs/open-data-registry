  EPA Dynamically Downscaled Ensemble (EDDE) Version 1
Description: >-
  The data are a subset of the EPA Dynamically Downscaled Ensemble (EDDE), 
  Version 1. EDDE is a collection of physics-based modeled data that represent
  3D atmospheric conditions for historical and future periods under different
  scenarios. The EDDE Version 1 datasets cover the contiguous United States at
  a horizontal grid spacing of 36 kilometers at hourly increments. EDDE Version
  1 includes simulations that have been dynamically downscaled from multiple
  global climate models (GCMs) under both mid- and high-emission scenarios from
  the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) using the Weather
  Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Scenarios were downscaled from the
  Community Earth System Model (CESM) and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics
  Laboratory (GFDL) Coupled Model version 3 (CM3). Simulations followed the
  historical periods 1975-2005 (CESM only) and 1995-2005 (both CESM and CM3),
  and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 for 2025-2100 (CESM
  only), RCP6.0 for 2025-2055 (CESM only), and RCP8.5 (both CESM and CM3).
  Data are in Network Common Data Form (netCDF) version 4, which is used in
  atmospheric modeling. The EDDE data in netCDF are further written to adhere
  to principles of Climate and Forecasting System (CF) Compliance to enhance
  portability and interoperability with data from other sources. The files are
  self-describing with metadata included in the netCDF header. Data reference:

Resources:
  - Description: >-
      EDDE data are compressed netCDF (https://unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/)
      files that conform to Climate and Forecast (CF) metdata conventions 
      (https://cfconventions.org). The data can be ingested, processed, and
      visualized using standard netCDF utility routines in various programming
      languages. Information on the model projection and grid structure is contained
      in the header information of each netCDF file. Two timekeeping variables are
      in the files. The variable "time" conforms to CF conventions using the "hours
      since" construct, where the reference time is given as the initialization of
      the simulation. The "mtime" variable is a user-readable string that aligns
      with "time" expressed as YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MI:SS. Additional information can be
      found at https://www.epa.gov/climate-research/climate-change-tools-protect-public-health-and-environment
