Name: Met Office Global Ocean model on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: The Global Ocean component of the Met Office Global Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice system which has been running in operations since May 2022. 
  The system provides a global physical analysis and coupled forecast products providing 3D daily mean fields of temperature 
  and salinity, zonal and meridional velocities; 2D daily mean fields of sea surface height, bottom temperature, mixed layer depth, 
  sea ice fraction, sea ice thickness and sea ice zonal and meridional velocities; and instantaneous hourly fields for sea surface 
  height, sea surface temperature and surface currents. The Met Office Global Coupled Atmosphere-Land-Ocean-Ice system is comprised of both deterministic and
  ensemble forecasting systems both of which are coupled to an interactive ocean. Ocean and ice analysis and
  forecast products are currently generated from the deterministic system once a day with forecast with lead time
  out to 7 days, interpolated onto a regular latitude-longitude grid products by our Global Marine Post Processing
  (MaPP-GL) system.

UpdateFrequency: The Global Ocean model runs once daily. T+00h is the midnight prior to production, the following are produced. 
  T-48h to T-24h best estimate; T-24h to T+00h analyses; 7 day forecast (from T+00h).
