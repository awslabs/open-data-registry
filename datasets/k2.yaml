Name: K2 Mission Data
Description: |
  The K2 mission observed 100 square degrees for 80 days each across 20 different pointings along the ecliptic, collecting high-precision photometry for a selection of targets within each field. The mission began when the original Kepler mission ended due to loss of the second reaction wheel in 2013.
