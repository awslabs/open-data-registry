Description: "Here, we collected and pre-processed a massive, high-quality 7T fMRI\
  \ dataset that can be used to advance our understanding of how the brain works.\
  \ A unique feature of this dataset is the massive amount of data available per individual\
  \ subject. The data were acquired using ultra-high-field fMRI (7T, whole-brain,\
  \ 1.8-mm resolution, 1.6-s TR). We measured fMRI responses while each of 8 participants\
  \ viewed 9,000\u201310,000 distinct, color natural scenes (22,500\u201330,000 trials)\
  \ in 30\u201340 weekly scan sessions over the course of a year. Additional measures\
  \ were collected including resting-state data, retinotopy, category localizers,\
  \ anatomical data (T1, T2, diffusion, venogram, angiogram), physiological data (pulse,\
  \ respiration), eye-tracking data, and additional behavioral assessments outside\
  \ the scanner. Because of its unprecedented scale and richness, NSD can be used\
  \ to explore diverse neuroscientific questions with high power at the level of individual\
  \ subjects. In particular, the number of images sampled in this dataset is sufficiently\
  \ large that the dataset may be of high interest for computer vision, machine learning,\
  \ and other data-driven applications."

UpdateFrequency: This dataset is now released. A small portion of the data is held
  out and will be released in the future. Besides that, we do not expect major updates,
  aside from any corrections or additions that arise (these will be logged on the
  NSD Data Manual).
