Name: OPERA Dynamic Surface Water Extent from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 product (Version 1)
Description: "This dataset contains Level-3 Dynamic OPERA surface water extent product
  version 1.  The data are validated surface water extent observations beginning April
  2023. Known issues and caveats on usage are described under Documentation. The input
  dataset for generating each product is the Harmonized Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A/B/C
  (HLS) product version 2.0. HLS products provide surface reflectance (SR) data from
  the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the Landsat 8 satellite and the MultiSpectral
  Instrument (MSI) aboard the Sentinel-2A/B/C satellite. The surface water extent
  products are distributed over projected map coordinates using the Universal Transverse
  Mercator (UTM) projection. Each UTM tile covers an area of 109.8 km × 109.8 km.
  This area is divided into 3,660 rows and 3,660 columns at 30-m pixel spacing. Each
  product is distributed as a set of 10 GeoTIFF (Geographic Tagged Image File Format)
  files including water classification, associated confidence, land cover classification,
  terrain shadow layer, cloud/cloud-shadow classification, Digital elevation model
  (DEM), and Diagnostic layer.\n<br><br>\nThe digital elevation model (DEM) provided
  as a layer of the DSWx-HLS product (band 10) was generated using the Copernicus
  DEM 30-m and Copernicus DEM 90-m models provided by the European Space Agency. The
  Copernicus DEM 30-m and Copernicus DEM 90-m were produced using Copernicus WorldDEM-30

  DSWx-HLS product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2023-2025).\n<br><br>\nTo
