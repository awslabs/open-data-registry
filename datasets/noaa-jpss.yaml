Description: "*Near Real Time JPSS data is now flowing! See bucket information on\
  \ the right side of this page to access products!*\n\n <br /> Satellites in the\
  \ JPSS constellation gather global measurements of atmospheric, terrestrial and\
  \ oceanic conditions, including sea and land surface temperatures, vegetation, clouds,\
  \ rainfall, snow and ice cover, fire locations and smoke plumes, atmospheric temperature,\
  \ water vapor and ozone. JPSS delivers key observations for the Nation's essential\
  \ products and services, including forecasting severe weather like hurricanes, tornadoes\
  \ and blizzards days in advance, and assessing environmental hazards such as droughts,\
  \ forest fires, poor air quality and harmful coastal waters. Further, JPSS will\
  \ provide continuity of critical, global observations of Earth\u2019s atmosphere,\
  \ oceans and land through 2038. The data will be available from 2012-01-19 to present.\
