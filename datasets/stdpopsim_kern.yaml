Description: Contains all resources (genome specifications, recombination maps, etc.)
  required for species specific simulation with the stdpopsim package. These resources
  are originally from a variety of other consortium and published work but are consolidated
  here for ease of access and use. If you are interested in adding a new species to
  the stdpopsim resource please raise an issue on the stdpopsim GitHub page to have
  the necessary files added here.
