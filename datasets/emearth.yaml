Name: Ensemble Meteorological Dataset for Planet Earth, EM-Earth 
Description: EM-Earth provides data for precipitation, mean air temperature, air temperature range, and dew-point temperature at 0.1Â° spatial resolution over global land areas from 1950 to 2019. EM-Earth provides hourly/daily deterministic estimates, and daily probabilistic estimates (25 ensemble members), to meet the diverse requirements of hydrometeorological applications.
