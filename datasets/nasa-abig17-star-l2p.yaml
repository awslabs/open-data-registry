Name: GHRSST NOAA/STAR GOES-17 ABI L2P America Region SST v2.71 dataset in GDS2
Description: GOES-17 (G17) is the second satellite in the US NOAA's GOES-R series. It was launched on 1 Mar 2018 in an interim position at 89.5-deg W for initial Cal/Val, moved to its nominal position at 137.2-deg W in Nov 2018, and declared NOAA operational GOES-West satellite on 12 Feb 2019. Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) is a 16 channel sensor, of which five (3.9, 8.4, 10.3, 11.2, 12.3 um) are suitable for SST. From altitude 35,800km, G17/ABI maps SST in a Full Disk (FD) area from 163E-77W and 60S-60N, with spatial resolution 2km/nadir to 15km/VZA 67-deg, and 10-min temporal sampling.
