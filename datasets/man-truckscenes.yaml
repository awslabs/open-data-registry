Name: MAN TruckScenes
Description: 
  A large scale multimodal dataset for Autonomous Trucking.
  Sensor data was recorded with a heavy truck from MAN equipped with 6 lidars, 6 radars, 4 cameras and a high-precision GNSS.
  MAN TruckScenes allows the research community to come into contact with truck-specific challenges, such as trailer occlusions, novel sensor perspectives, and terminal environments for the first time.

  It comprises more than 740 scenes of 20s each within a multitude of different environmental conditions.
  Bounding boxes are available for 27 object classes, 15 attributes, and a range of more than 230m.
  The scenes are tagged according to 34 distinct scene tags, and all objects are tracked throughout the scene to promote a wide range of applications.
