Name: Continuous EEG Predicts Delayed Cerebral Ischemia After SAH
Description: >
  This dataset includes continuous EEG (cEEG) recordings and clinical metadata from 103 patients with subarachnoid 
  hemorrhage (SAH) monitored at Massachusetts General Hospital between 2013–2015. The data supports the study 
  demonstrating cEEG’s ability to predict delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) before clinical symptoms appear. 
  Included are R and MATLAB scripts implementing multi-state survival analysis and diagnostic accuracy assessments.
