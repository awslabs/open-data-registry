Name: Met Office UK Site-Specific Blended Probabilistic Forecast on a 2-year rolling archive 
Description: The flagship Numerical Weather Prediction model developed and used at the Met Office, is the Unified Model, the same model is used for both weather and climate prediction. For weather forecasting the Met Office runs several configurations of the Unified Model as part of its operational Numerical Weather Prediction suite. Uncovering 2 years' worth of historical data, updated regularly with a time delay.
  The UK Site-Specific Blended Probabilistic Forecast is a post processed regional downscaled configuration of the Unified Model, covering the UK and Ireland. The United Kingdom domain is a 2km resolution grid. Formatted via NetCDF.
  Data is blended from up to 4 forecasting models; an extrapolation nowcast (MONOW), UKV, MOGREPS-UK, and MOGREPS-G.
