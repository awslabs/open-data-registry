Name: "DialoGLUE: A Natural Language Understanding Benchmark for Task-Oriented Dialogue"
Description: |
  This bucket contains the checkpoints used to reproduce the baseline results reported in the DialoGLUE benchmark hosted
  on EvalAI (https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/708/overview). The associated scripts for using the checkpoints are located here:
  https://github.com/alexa/dialoglue. The associated paper describing the benchmark and checkpoints is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13570.
  The provided checkpoints include the CONVBERT model, a BERT-esque model trained on a large open-domain conversational
  dataset. It also includes the CONVBERT-DG and BERT-DG checkpoints described in the linked
  paper.
