      Dialogue'

Description: 'This bucket contains the checkpoints used to reproduce the baseline
  results reported in the DialoGLUE benchmark hosted

  on EvalAI (https://evalai.cloudcv.org/web/challenges/challenge-page/708/overview).
  The associated scripts for using the checkpoints are located here:

  https://github.com/alexa/dialoglue. The associated paper describing the benchmark
  and checkpoints is here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13570.

  The provided checkpoints include the CONVBERT model, a BERT-esque model trained
  on a large open-domain conversational

  dataset. It also includes the CONVBERT-DG and BERT-DG checkpoints described in the
  linked

  paper.
