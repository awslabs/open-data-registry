Name: MODIS/Terra+Aqua MAIAC Land Aerosol Optical Depth Daily L2G 1 km SIN Grid in Cloud-Optimized GeoTiff (COG)
Description: |
  0.47 μm and 0.55 μm Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over land in Cloud-Optimized GeoTiff (COG) format, generated from the MCD19A2 Version 6 data product. MCD19A2 is a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra and Aqua combined Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) Land Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) gridded Level 2 product produced daily at 1 kilometer (km) pixel resolution (source: https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd19a2v006/).
  Satellite measurements of aerosols, called aerosol optical thickness, are based on the fact that the particles change the way the atmosphere reflects and absorbs visible and infrared light. An optical thickness of less than 0.1 (palest yellow) indicates a crystal clear sky with maximum visibility, whereas a value of 1 (reddish brown) indicates very hazy conditions.
