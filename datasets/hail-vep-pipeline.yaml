Description: VEP determines the effect of genetic variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions,
  CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence, as well
  as regulatory regions. The European Bioinformatics Institute produces the VEP tool/db
  and releases updates every 1 - 6 months. The latest release contains 267 genomes
  from 232 species containing 5567663 protein coding genes. This dataset hosts the
  last 5 releases for human, rat, and zebrafish. Also, it hosts the required reference
  files for the Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE) plugin as it
  is commonly used with VEP.
