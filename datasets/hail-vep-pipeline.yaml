Name: Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) and the Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE) Plugin
Description: VEP determines the effect of genetic variants (SNPs, insertions, deletions, CNVs or structural variants) on genes, transcripts, and protein sequence, as well as regulatory regions. The European Bioinformatics Institute produces the VEP tool/db and releases updates every 1 - 6 months. The latest release contains 267 genomes from 232 species containing 5567663 protein coding genes. This dataset hosts the last 5 releases for human, rat, and zebrafish. Also, it hosts the required reference files for the Loss-Of-Function Transcript Effect Estimator (LOFTEE) plugin as it is commonly used with VEP.
