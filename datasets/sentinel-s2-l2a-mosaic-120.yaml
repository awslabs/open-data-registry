Description: Sentinel-2 L2A 120m mosaic is a derived product, which contains best
  pixel values for 10-daily periods, modelled by removing the cloudy pixels and then
  performing interpolation among remaining values. As there are some parts of the
  world, which have lengthy cloudy periods, clouds might be remaining in some parts.
  The actual modelling script is available [here](https://sentinel-hub.github.io/custom-scripts/sentinel-2/interpolated_time_series/).
Documentation: Documentation is available [here](https://sentinel-s2-l2a-mosaic-120.s3.amazonaws.com/readme.html).
