  Description: "The U.S. Climate Normals are a large suite of data products that provide\
    \ information about typical climate conditions for thousands of locations across\
    \ the United States. Normals act both as a ruler to compare today\u2019s weather\
    \ and tomorrow\u2019s forecast, and as a predictor of conditions in the near future.\
    \ The official normals are calculated for a uniform 30 year period, and consist\
    \ of annual/seasonal, monthly, daily, and hourly averages and statistics of temperature,\
    \ precipitation, and other climatological variables from almost 15,000 U.S. weather\
    \ stations. <br/><br/>\nNCEI generates the official U.S. normals every 10 years\
    \ in keeping with the needs of our user community and the requirements of the\
    \ World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and National Weather Service (NWS).\
    \ The 1991\u20132020 U.S. Climate Normals are the latest in a series of decadal\
    \ normals first produced in the 1950s. These data allow travelers to pack the\
    \ right clothes, farmers to plant the best crop varieties, and utilities to plan\
    \ for seasonal energy usage. Many other important economic decisions that are\
    \ made beyond the predictive range of standard weather forecasts are either based\
    \ on or influenced by climate normals.\n", Documentation: '[https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/us-climate-normals](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/us-climate-normals);
