Description: "RarePlanes is a unique open-source machine learning dataset from CosmiQ\
  \ Works and AI.Reverie that incorporates both real and synthetically generated satellite\
  \ imagery. The RarePlanes dataset specifically focuses on the value of AI.Reverie\
  \ synthetic data to aid computer vision algorithms in their ability to automatically\
  \ detect aircraft and their attributes in satellite imagery. Although other synthetic/real\
  \ combination datasets exist, RarePlanes is the largest openly-available very high\
  \ resolution dataset built to test the value of synthetic data from an overhead\
  \ perspective. The real portion of the dataset consists of 253 Maxar WorldView-3\
  \ satellite scenes spanning 112 locations and 2,142 km^2 with 14,700 hand-annotated\
  \ aircraft. The accompanying synthetic dataset is generated via AI.Reverie\u2019\
  s novel simulation platform and features 50,000 synthetic satellite images with\
  \ ~630,000 aircraft annotations."
