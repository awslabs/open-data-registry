    Title: Urban Tree Detection
    URL: https://github.com/jonathanventura/urban-tree-detection
Description: The National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) acquires aerial imagery
  during the agricultural growing seasons in the continental U.S. This "leaf-on" imagery
  andtypically ranges from 30 centimeters to 100 centimeters in resolution and is
  available from the naip-analytic Amazon S3 bucket as 4-band (RGB + NIR) imagery
  in MRF format, on naip-source Amazon S3 bucket as 4-band (RGB + NIR) in uncompressed
  Raw GeoTiff format and naip-visualization as 3-band (RGB) Cloud Optimized GeoTiff
  format. More details on [NAIP](https://naip-usdaonline.hub.arcgis.com/)

Name: NAIP on AWS
Resources:
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::naip-analytic
  Description: The data in this bucket is 4-band (RGB + NIR) in MRF format and Cloud
    Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) processed by Esri. The MRF format is a cloud-optimized
    open data format that provides fast access to data on S3. MRF can be accessed
    using GDAL and most applications build using GDAL, but also directly by web applications.
    Data is provided as 512x512 tiles, with reduced-resolution pyramids created using
    2x sampling by averaging. Finally, data compression is efficient and lossless
    (meaning the data values here are the same as the source). A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF
    (COG) is a GeoTIFF file optimized for hosting on a HTTP file server. COG has an
    internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud by supporting
    HTTP GET range requests, where just parts of a file are requested and returned.
    The bucket is set as a Requester Pays bucket.
  Region: us-west-2
  RequesterPays: true
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::naip-source
  Description: The data in this bucket is Original Imagery in Geotiff format 4-band
    (RGB + NIR) uncompressed no overviews and metadata in a Requester Pays bucket
  Region: us-west-2
  RequesterPays: true
  Type: S3 Bucket
- ARN: arn:aws:s3:::naip-visualization
  Description: The data in this bucket is 3 band RGB in Geotiff format. It is converted
    and managed by Esri. This imagery is provided as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs, has
    been compressed using YCbCr JPEG with quality 85. It is provided as 512x512 tiles,
    with pyramids created using 2x sampling by averaging. The bucket is set as a Requester
    Pays bucket.
  Region: us-west-2

UpdateFrequency: NAIP data is provided state by state at varying time intervals. Each
  year, a variable number of states are updated with an overall update cycle of every
  two to three years for each state. This catalog currently includes NAIP imagery
  from 2010 through 2021 for most products.
