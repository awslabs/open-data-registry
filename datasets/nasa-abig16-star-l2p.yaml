Name: GHRSST NOAA/STAR GOES-16 ABI L2P America Region SST v2.70 dataset in GDS2
Description: "GOES-16 (G16) is the first satellite in the US NOAA third generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES), a.k.a. GOES-R series (which will also include -S, -T, and -U). G16 was launched on 19 Nov 2016 and initially placed in an interim position at 89.5-deg W, between GOES-East and -West. Upon completion of Cal/Val in Dec 2018, it was moved to its permanent position at 75.2-deg W, and declared NOAA operational GOES-East on 18 Dec 2018. \r\nNOAA is responsible for all GOES-R products, including Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI)."
