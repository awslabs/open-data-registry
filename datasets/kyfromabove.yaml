Name: KyFromAbove on AWS
Description: The KyFromAbove initiative is focused on building and maintaining a current basemap for Kentucky that can meet the needs of its users at the state, federal, local, and regional level. A common basemap, including current color leaf-off aerial photography and elevation data (LiDAR), reduces the cost of developing GIS applications, promotes data sharing, and add efficiencies to many business processes. All basemap data acquired through this effort is being made available in the public domain. KyFromAbove acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions in the Commonwealth. The imagery typically ranges from 6-inches to 3-inches in resolution and is available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket in a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff format. LiDAR data acquired by the program is USGS Quality Level 2 (QL2). Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at a 2-foot resolution, point cloud data in an LAS format, spot elevations in a geopackage format, and contours in a geopackage format are also available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket. KyFromAbove LiDAR and imagery data resources are managed in a Kentucky-specific 5000x5000 foot grid (FIPS:1600) (EPSG:3089). More details about the program can be found at (https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/)

ManagedBy: "[Kentucky Division of Geographic Information](https://kygeonet.ky.gov)"
UpdateFrequency: KyFromAbove data is typically updated on an annual basis. Each year, a portion of the state is acquired with an overall update cycle of every three to four years. This update cadance is determined by both funding and the length of leaf-off conditions in a given year. This catalog currently includes imagery and LiDAR data from 2010 through 2024 for most products.

  - Description: Elevation and imagery data resources for the Commonwealth of Kentucky are organized in this bucket. Elevation data is available in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and Geopackage formats depending on the data type. Imagery data is also available in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)format. A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a GeoTIFF file optimized for hosting on a HTTP file server. COG has an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud by supporting HTTP GET range requests, where just parts of a file are requested and returned.
