Name: KyFromAbove on AWS
Description: The KyFromAbove initiative is focused on building and maintaining a current basemap for Kentucky that can meet the needs of its users at the state, federal, local, and regional level. A common basemap, including current color leaf-off aerial photography and elevation data (LiDAR), reduces the cost of developing GIS applications, promotes data sharing, and add efficiencies to many business processes. All basemap data acquired through this effort is being made available in the public domain. KyFromAbove acquires aerial imagery and LiDAR during leaf-off conditions in the Commonwealth. The imagery typically ranges from 6-inches to 3-inches in resolution and is available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket in a Cloud Optimized GeoTiff format. LiDAR data acquired by the program is USGS Quality Level 2 (QL2). Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) at a 2-foot resolution, point cloud data in an LAS format, spot elevations in a geopackage format, and contours in a geopackage format are also available from the kyfromabove Amazon S3 bucket. KyFromAbove LiDAR and imagery data resources are managed in a Kentucky-specific 5000x5000 foot grid (FIPS:1600) (EPSG:3089). More details about the program can be found at (https://kyfromabove.ky.gov/)

ManagedBy: "[Kentucky Division of Geographic Information](https://kygeonet.ky.gov)"
UpdateFrequency: KyFromAbove data is typically updated on an annual basis. Each year, a portion of the state is acquired with an overall update cycle of every three to four years. This update cadance is determined by both funding and the length of leaf-off conditions in a given year. This catalog currently includes imagery and LiDAR data from 2010 through 2022 for most products.

Resources:
  - Description: Elevation and imagery data resources for the Commonwealth of Kentucky are organized in this bucket. Elevation data is available in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) and Geopackage formats depending on the data type. Imagery data is also available in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)format. A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) is a GeoTIFF file optimized for hosting on a HTTP file server. COG has an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud by supporting HTTP GET range requests, where just parts of a file are requested and returned.

  - Description: Topographic contours created from the KyFromAbove Phase 1 LiDAR-derived digital elevation model (DEM) in a geopackage and Esri file geodatabase format. There are four data resources in this folder - 1) KyTopo contours at a 10-foot interval primarily for Western and Central Kentucky, 2) KyTopo contours at a 20-foot interval primarily for Central and Eastern Kentucky, 3) KyTopo contours at a 40-foot interval for Eastern Kentucky, and 4) KyTopo contours at a 5-foot interval for the entire Commonwealth.

  - Description: LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEM) for the Commonwealth of Kentucky organized in a 5000x5000 foot grid. There are currently three data resources in this folder - 1) Phase 1 LiDAR-derived DEMs at a 5 foot resolution, 2) Phase 2 LiDAR-derived DEMs at a 2 foot resolution, and 3) Phase 3 LiDAR-derived DEMs at a 2 foot resolution. All data has been converted to a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format. Phase 2 and Phase 3 efforts have not achieved Statewide coverage to date.

  - Description: There are three data resources in this folder - 1) KyTopo Map Series quadrangles in a Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, 2) KyTopo Map Series quadrangles with all collar information in a non-georeferenced PNG format for printing on a standard ARCH-D sized sheet, and 3) the KyTopo Map Series quadrangles tile grid in a geopackage format. The COGs were created using GDAL with JPEG compression at a 90% quality setting and the default 512x512 tile setting.

There is currently one data resource in this folder -  1) Phase 1 LiDAR-derived point clouds in LAZ format. Phase 2 and Phase 3 efforts have not achieved Statewide coverage to date. It is our aim to provide Phase 2 and Phase 3 data in a COPC (LAZ format).
