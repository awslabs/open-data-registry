Description: 'A dataset intended to support research on machine learning

  techniques for detecting malware.  It includes metadata and EMBER-v2

  features for approximately 10 million benign and 10 million malicious

  Portable Executable files, with disarmed but otherwise complete

  files for all malware samples.  All samples are labeled using Sophos

  in-house labeling methods, have features extracted using the

  EMBER-v2 feature set, well as metadata obtained via the pefile

  python library, detection counts obtained via ReversingLabs

  telemetry, and additional behavioral tags that indicate the rough

  behavior of the samples.
