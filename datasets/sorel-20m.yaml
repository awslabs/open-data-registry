Name: Sophos/ReversingLabs 20 Million malware detection dataset
Description: |
  A dataset intended to support research on machine learning
  techniques for detecting malware.  It includes metadata and EMBER-v2
  features for approximately 10 million benign and 10 million malicious
  Portable Executable files, with disarmed but otherwise complete
  files for all malware samples.  All samples are labeled using Sophos
  in-house labeling methods, have features extracted using the
  EMBER-v2 feature set, well as metadata obtained via the pefile
  python library, detection counts obtained via ReversingLabs
  telemetry, and additional behavioral tags that indicate the rough
  behavior of the samples.
