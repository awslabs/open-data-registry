Name: Google Books Ngrams
Description: N-grams are fixed size tuples of items. In this case the items are words extracted from the Google Books corpus. The n specifies the number of elements in the tuple, so a 5-gram contains five words or characters. The n-grams in this dataset were produced by passing a sliding window of the text of books and outputting a record for each new token.
