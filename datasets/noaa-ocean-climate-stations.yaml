Name: NOAA/PMEL Ocean Climate Stations Moorings
Description: |
  The mission of the Ocean Climate Stations (OCS) Project is to make meteorological and 
  oceanic measurements from autonomous platforms.  Calibrated, quality-controlled, and well-documented 
  climatological measurements are available on the OCS webpage and the OceanSITES Global Data
  Assembly Centers (GDACs), with near-realtime data available prior to release of the complete, 
  downloaded datasets.<br/><br/>
  
  OCS measurements served through the Big Data Program come from OCS high-latitude moored buoys located in the Kuroshio 
  Extension (32째N 145째E) and the Gulf of Alaska (50째N 145째W).  Initiated in 2004 and 2007, 
  the respective moored buoys, KEO and Papa, measure a suite of surface and subsurface essential ocean variables.
  The surface suite includes air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave and longwave radiation, barometric pressure, winds, and rain, 
  while subsurface instrumentation includes temperature, salinity, and ocean currents.  Individual buoy deployments are stitched together into 
  a continuous time-series, which is synced to the OceanSITES GDACs, and subsequently, to BDP.
