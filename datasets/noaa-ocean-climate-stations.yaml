Description: "The mission of the Ocean Climate Stations (OCS) Project is to make meteorological\
  \ and \noceanic measurements from autonomous platforms.  Calibrated, quality-controlled,\
  \ and well-documented \nclimatological measurements are available on the OCS webpage\
  \ and the OceanSITES Global Data\nAssembly Centers (GDACs), with near-realtime data\
  \ available prior to release of the complete, \ndownloaded datasets.<br/><br/>\n\
  \nOCS measurements served through the Big Data Program come from OCS high-latitude\
  \ moored buoys located in the Kuroshio \nExtension (32\xB0N 145\xB0E) and the Gulf\
  \ of Alaska (50\xB0N 145\xB0W).  Initiated in 2004 and 2007, \nthe respective moored\
  \ buoys, KEO and Papa, measure a suite of surface and subsurface essential ocean\
  \ variables.\nThe surface suite includes air temperature, relative humidity, shortwave\
  \ and longwave radiation, barometric pressure, winds, and rain, \nwhile subsurface\
  \ instrumentation includes temperature, salinity, and ocean currents.  Individual\
  \ buoy deployments are stitched together into \na continuous time-series, which\
  \ is synced to the OceanSITES GDACs, and subsequently, to BDP.\n"
