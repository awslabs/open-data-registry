Name: Targeted Metabolomics in the REGARDS Stroke Case-Cohort Study
Description: >
  This dataset contains targeted metabolomics data generated from plasma samples collected in the REasons for 
  Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) Study. The study used a nested case-cohort design with 
  2,378 samples to evaluate metabolic biomarkers of ischemic stroke risk. Plasma metabolite profiles were acquired 
  using Agilent 6495 QQQ mass spectrometry in both positive and negative ionization modes and preprocessed using 
  standardized protein precipitation extraction and normalization techniques.
