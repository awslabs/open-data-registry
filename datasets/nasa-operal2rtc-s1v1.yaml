Name: OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 validated
  product (Version 1)
Description: "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis
  (OPERA) Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1)
  validated product consists of radar backscatter normalized with respect to the topography.
  The product maps signals related to the physical properties of ground scattering
  objects, such as surface roughness and soil moisture and/or vegetation. The OPERA
  RTC-S1 product is derived from Copernicus Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW) Single
  Look Complex (SLC) data with a near global scope and temporal sampling coincident
  with the availability of S1 SLC data. \n\nEach OPERA RTC-S1 product corresponds
  to a single S1 burst projected onto a pre-defined UTM/Polar stereographic map projection
  system map grid with a 30-meter spacing. The Copernicus global 30 m (GLO-30) Digital
  Elevation Model (DEM) is the reference DEM used to correct for the impacts of topography
  and to geocode the product.  The OPERA RTC-S1 product is normalized to the backscatter
  coefficient gamma-naught, ɣ0,  obtained from the original radar brightness beta-naught,
  β0,  through radiometric terrain correction.  The RTC-S1 product is distributed
  as cloud optimized GeoTIFFs with one GeoTIFF file per processed polarization. The
  RTC-S1 product metadata is provided in the Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5)
  format. The OPERA RTC-S1 product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2022-2025).\n\nDue
  to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers such as incidence
  angle, local incidence angle, number of looks, and RTC Area Normalization Factor
  (ANF) vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are
  considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA RTC-S1
  product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account
  for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static-layers generation algorithm.
  The static layers are available in the associated OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected
  SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 Static Layers validated product (Version 1) dataset.\nRead
