Name: NCEP/CPC L3 Half Hourly 4km Global (60S - 60N) Merged IR V1 (GPM_MERGIR) at
  GES DISC
Description: "These data originate from NOAA/NCEP.\n\nThe NOAA Climate Prediction
  Center/NCEP/NWS is making the data available originally in binary format, in a weekly
  rotating archive. The NASA GES DISC is acquiring the binary files as they become
  available, converts them into CF (Climate and Forecast) -convention compliant netCDF-4
  format, and stores the product in a permanent archive. The original record started
  from February, 2000, but in June, 2025 it was extended back to January, 1998.\n\nThe
  leading edge of data availability is delayed by about 24 hours from real-time to
  abide by international data exchange agreements between NOAA and EUMETSAT (the METEOSAT
  data providers).\n\nThe data contain globally-merged (60°S-60°N) 4-km pixel-resolution
  IR brightness temperature data (equivalent blackbody temps), merged from the European,
  Japanese, and U.S. geostationary satellites over the period of record (GOES-8/9/10/11/12/13/14/15/16/17/18/19,
  METEOSAT-5/7/8/9/10/11, and GMS-5/MTSat-1R/2/Himawari-8/9).\n\nThe global geo-IR
  are dynamically calibrated to GOES East, using a 35 day trailing inter-calibration
  using time/space-matched IR Tb’s at the mid-point between sub-satellite positions.
  \ In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the value with the smaller zenith
  angle is taken. The data have been corrected for \"zenith angle dependence\", in
  which IR temperatures for locations far from satellite nadir are erroneously cold
  due to a combination of geometric effects and radiometric path extinction effects
  (Joyce et al. 2001). Finally, the data are re-navigated for parallax, which shifts
  the geo-location of the GEO-IR footprints to approximately account for the cloud
  tops that the IR “sees” being displaced away from their actual geographic location
  when viewed along a slanted path. These corrections allow for the merging of the
  IR data from the various GEO-satellites with greatly reduced discontinuities at
  GEO-satellite data boundaries. In the event of duplicate data in a grid box, the
  value with the smaller zenith angle is taken.\n\nThe NASA GES DISC is curating these
  data in a self-documenting, CF-compliant, netCDF-4 format, which allows a broad
  range of applications to access the data directly, without the need to cope with
  the original binary data format. In addition to the direct download of netCDF-4
  data, the GES DISC provides data download in binary, ASCII, and netCDF-3 formats
  using the OPeNDAP interface.\n\nSimilarities with the original\n-----------------------------\nAs
  in the original binaries, every netCDF-4 file covers one hour, and contains two
  half-hourly grids, at 4-km grid cell resolution. \n\nDifferences from the original\n-----------------------------\n1.
  The data in the netCDF-4 files are already converted to real (float) values of Brightness
  Temperatures in Kelvin. There is no need to further scale these data. The netCDF-4
  format is machine-independent and users need not worry about the endian-ness of
  their machines. \n\n2. To meet the requirements of collection spatial metadata,
  the grid is re-ordered from the original and now goes from -180 (West) to 180 (East).
  It is also starting from -60 (South).\n\nThe data and time units are reflected in
  the corresponding \"units\" attributes, and grid dimensions are described by longitude
  (\"lon\"), latitude (\"lat\") and \"time\" vectors. Thus, any CF-compliant tool
  should automatically understand the setup in the data files and the starting time
  for each half-hourly grid. Even without such tools, simple \"ncdump\" or \"h5dump\"
  command line tools will easily disclose the netCDF-4 files configuration.\n\nAcknowledgements\n------------------\nThe
  creation of the original data at NOAA/NCEP is supported by funding from the NOAA
  Office of Global Programs for the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP)
  and by NASA via the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). \n\nThe permanent
