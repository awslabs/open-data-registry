Name: real-changesets
Description: |
  The real-changesets is an augmented representation of OpenStreetMap changesets in JSON format. It contains the current and the previous version of each feature in a changeset.
  It's primary used by OSMCha, the main OpenStreetMap validation tool, to have a visualization of the changeset and provide to the user the understanding of what was changed on the map.
  The real-changesets are created by combining the changeset metadata and the augmented diff generated by overpass.
