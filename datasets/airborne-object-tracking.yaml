Description: Airborne Object Tracking (AOT) is a collection of 4,943 flight sequences
  of around 120 seconds each, collected at 10 Hz in diverse conditions. There are
  5.9M+ images and 3.3M+ 2D annotations of airborne objects in the sequences. There
  are 3,306,350 frames without labels as they contain no airborne objects. For images
  with labels, there are on average 1.3 labels per image. All airborne objects in
  the dataset are labelled.

  Description: The training dataset is further split into smaller directories. Each
    subdirectory contains ImageSets and Images folders. Metadata and ground truth
    information about image sequences are saved as groundtruth.json (and its tabular
    representation  groundtruth.csv) in ImageSets folders. Information about airborne
    encounters are saved in  valid_encounters_maxRange700_maxGap3_minEncLen30.json
    and valid_encounters_maxRange700_maxGap3_minEncLen30.csv. The Images folder holds
    images sampled from one sequence per directory. Images are 2448 pixels wide by
    2048 pixels high, encoded as 8-bit grayscale images and saved as PNG files.
