Name: DNAStack COVID19 SRA Data
Description: >
  The [Sequence Read Archive (SRA)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/) is the primary archive of high-throughput sequencing data, hosted by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The SRA represents the largest publicly available repository of SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data.
  This dataset was created by DNAstack using SARS-CoV-2 sequencing data sourced from the SRA. Where possible, raw sequence data were processed by DNAstack through a unified bioinformatics pipeline to produce genome assemblies and variant calls. The use of a standardized workflow to produce this harmonized dataset allows public data generated using different methodologies to be combined and compared for a more powerful global analysis of available SARS-CoV-2 data, allowing researchers rapid access to aggregated downstream results for accelerated insight generation.
  Methodology: Reads from the SRA were extracted in FASTQ format, then entered into a different pipeline depending on the sequencing technology used to create the reads: the [ARTIC protocol](https://artic.network/ncov-2019/ncov2019-bioinformatics-sop.html) for Oxford Nanopore-derived reads; the [SIGNAL pipeline](https://github.com/jaleezyy/covid-19-signal) for paired-end Illumina reads; and the [CoSA pipeline](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/CoSA) (using [DeepVariant](https://github.com/google/deepvariant) for variant calling) for PacBio reads. Briefly, reads were primer-trimmed and aligned to the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome, following which contiguous regions were assembled and variant sites were called. [Pangolin](https://github.com/cov-lineages/pangolin) was then used to assign viral lineage based on the assembled genome.
