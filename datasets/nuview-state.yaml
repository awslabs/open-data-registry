Name: NUVIEW - Multi-State Geospatial Data
Description: |
  NUVIEW hosts and manages a unified collection of geospatial datasets from multiple U.S. states and agencies
  (LiDAR, orthophoto imagery, DEM/DSM, and derivative products). Data are organized in a
  single S3 bucket with a logical sub-folder hierarchy: `/state_or_agency_product_type/acqusition_project_name/...`. All assets
  are cloud-optimized (COG GeoTIFFs, COPC (Cloud Optimized Point Cloud) LAZ point clouds, etc.) and available under open licenses.
Documentation: Documentation is available for this data at the [s22s/nuview-state-opendata GitHub repository](https://github.com/s22s/nuview-state-opendata) maintained by NUVIEW.
