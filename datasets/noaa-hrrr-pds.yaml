Name: NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Model
Description: >
  The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh.
  <br />
  <br />
  The HRRR ZARR formatted data was originally generated by the University of Utah under a grant provided by NOAA. They are are continuing to publish ZARR versions of HRRR data. For information about data in the s3://hrrrzarr/ please contact atmos-mesowest@lists.utah.edu.
