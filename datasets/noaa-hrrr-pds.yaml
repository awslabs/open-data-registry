Description: 'The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving,
  convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation.
  Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further
  detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced
  Rapid Refresh.
