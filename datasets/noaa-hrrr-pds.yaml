Name: NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) Model
Description: >
  The HRRR is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution, hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model, initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh.
  <br />
  <br />
  The HRRR ZARR formatted data was originally generated by the University of Utah under a grant provided by NOAA. They are are continuing to publish ZARR versions of HRRR data. For information about data in the s3://hrrrzarr/ please contact atmos-mesowest@lists.utah.edu.

  For any questions regarding data delivery or any general questions regarding the NOAA Open Data Dissemination (NODD) Program, email the NODD Team at nodd@noaa.gov.
  <br /> We also seek to identify case studies on how NOAA data is being used and will be featuring those stories in joint publications and in upcoming events. If you are interested in seeing your story highlighted, please share it with the NODD team by emailing nodd@noaa.gov
