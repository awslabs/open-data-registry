Name: NOAA NASA Joint Archive (NNJA) of Observations for Earth System Reanalysis
Description: |
  The NOAA NASA Joint Archive (NNJA) of Observations for Earth System Reanalysis is a curated joint observation archive containing Earth system data from 1979 to present prepared by teams at NOAA's Physical Sciences Laboratory and NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. The goal is to foster collaboration across organizations and develop the ability for direct comparison of Earth System reanalysis results. Providing a singular dataset for observation input use will allow reanalyses to be compared on their unique development qualities by removing the variation from using different observations. We anticipate that the open dataset will be of value to the wider Earth System community, including future applications outside of the original goal of reanalysis production.

  The archive is hosted in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket with atmosphere, ice, land and ocean observations in formats including bufr, ioda, and netcdf. The general structure file structure is noaa-reanalyses-pds/observations/reanalysis/{sensor}/{source(s)}/YYYY/MM/{file format}/{data files}. Some data is reprocessed as appropriate. The dataset also includes specification of observational errors and a black/white list for historic observations which can be access via the [NNJA site](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/nnja_obs/).
