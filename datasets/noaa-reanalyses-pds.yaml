Description: 'The NOAA NASA Joint Archive (NNJA) of Observations for Earth System
  Reanalysis is a curated joint observation archive containing Earth system data from
  1979 to present prepared by teams at NOAA''s Physical Sciences Laboratory and NASA''s
  Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. The goal is to foster collaboration across
  organizations and develop the ability for direct comparison of Earth System reanalysis
  results. Providing a singular dataset for observation input use will allow reanalyses
  to be compared on their unique development qualities by removing the variation from
  using different observations. We anticipate that the open dataset will be of value
  to the wider Earth System community, including future applications outside of the
  original goal of reanalysis production.

  <br/>

  <br/>

  The archive is hosted in an Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket with atmosphere,
  ice, land and ocean observations in formats including bufr, ioda, and netcdf. The
  general structure file structure is noaa-reanalyses-pds/observations/reanalysis/{sensor}/{source(s)}/YYYY/MM/{file
  format}/{data files}. Some data is reprocessed as appropriate. The dataset also
  includes specification of observational errors and a black/white list for historic
  observations which can be access via the [NNJA site](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/nnja_obs/).
