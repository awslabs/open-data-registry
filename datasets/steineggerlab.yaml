Name: Steinegger Lab Datasets
Description: |
  The Steinegger Lab Dataset comprises biological databases and resources critical for protein sequence and structure analysis, developed to support ColabFold, MMseqs2, and Foldseek/Foldcomp—three high-performance computational tools widely used in bioinformatics.
 
  The MMseqs2 dataset serves as the backbone for our fast structure prediction tool, ColabFold, and includes UniRef30, BFD, and the ColabFold environmental databases.
  These datasets are specifically designed for the rapid generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which are essential for high-accuracy structure prediction.
  Beyond MSA generation, these resources allow for fast taxonomy annotations and functional annotation, supporting a wide range of bioinformatics applications.
 
  The Foldseek dataset includes preprocessed databases such as the AlphaFold Database (AFDB), PDB, SwissProt, and CATH, specifically designed for protein structure similarity searches.
  These datasets encompass the majority of both experimental and predicted structural resources, supporting analyses for monomers and multimers alike.
