Name: Public Utility Data Liberation Project
Description: |
  The Public Utility Data Liberation Project (PUDL) provides analysis-ready U.S. energy
  system data in bulk for programmatic use. Sources include the U.S. Energy
  Information Administration (EIA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
  Safety Administration (PHMSA), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The
  primary focus is on the electricity sector, with additional data on the natural gas
  system and energy company financial reporting.

UpdateFrequency: |
  New outputs published nightly as part of our continuous integration process.
  New data is integrated on a rolling basis as it is published by the original sources.
  Agencies typically release data monthly, quarterly, or yearly.
  New versioned releases of PUDL are published and archived at least once per quarter.
