Description: "The Public Utility Data Liberation Project (PUDL) provides analysis-ready\
  \ energy system data to climate advocates,\nresearchers, policymakers, and journalists.\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\n[PUDL](https://catalyst.coop/pudl/) is an [open source data processing\
  \ pipeline](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl)\nthat makes US energy\
  \ data easier to access and use programmatically. Hundreds of gigabytes of valuable\
  \ data\nare published by US government agencies, but it's often difficult to work\
  \ with.\nPUDL takes the original spreadsheets, CSV files, and databases and turns\
  \ them into a unified resource. This allows users to\nspend more time on novel analysis\
  \ and less time on data preparation.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis information allows users\
  \ to explore the operating costs of individual power plants, and see how fuel costs\
  \ impact\nthe viability of different types of generation.  It can highlight the\
  \ competitiveness of renewable electricity in the\nmarket today.  It can show how\
  \ the generation mix of different utilities has evolved over time, and how the usage\
  \ of\nindividual power plants has changed as fuel prices have changed and more renewable\
  \ generation has been brought online.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe data hosted on Amazon Web\
  \ Services is intended to be accessed through the \n[PUDL Intake Catalog](https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl-catalog).\n\
  The catalog allows users to access the data via a uniform API for each data type\
  \ (parquet, SQL),\nhandles local caching and provides rich metadata about the data.\n"
Documentation: "To access the data via the the PUDL intake catalog, follow the setup\n\
  [instructions in the documentation](https://catalystcoop-pudl-catalog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).\
  \ \nYou can learn more about the data in the [PUDL data dictionary documentation](https://catalystcoop-pudl.readthedocs.io/en/dev/data_dictionaries/index.html).\n"
