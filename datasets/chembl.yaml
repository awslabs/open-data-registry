Description: ChEMBL is a manually curated database of bioactive molecules with drug-like
  properties. It brings together chemical, bioactivity and genomic data to aid the
  translation of genomic information into effective new drugs. This representation
  of ChEMBL is stored in Parquet format and most easily utilized through Amazon Athena.
  Follow the documentation for install instructions (< 2 minute install). New ChEMBL
  releases occur sporadically; the most up to date information on ChEMBL releases
  can be found [here](https://chembl.gitbook.io/chembl-interface-documentation/downloads).
