Description: The Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS), previously known as the GFS
  Global ENSemble (GENS), is a weather forecast model made up of 21 separate forecasts,
  or ensemble members.  The National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) started
  the GEFS to address the nature of uncertainty in weather observations, which is
  used to initialize weather forecast models. The GEFS attempts to quantify the amount
  of uncertainty in a forecast by generating an ensemble of multiple forecasts, each
  minutely different, or perturbed, from the original observations. With global coverage,
  GEFS is produced four times a day with weather forecasts going out to 16 days.
