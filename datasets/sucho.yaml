Description: "The dataset contains web archives of Open Access collections of digitised\
  \ cultural heritage from more than 3,000+ websites of Ukrainian cultural institutions,\
  \ such as museums, libraries or archives. The web archives have been produced by\
  \ SUCHO, which is a volunteer group of more than 1,300 international cultural heritage\
  \ professionals \u2013 librarians, archivists, researchers, programmers - who have\
  \ joined forces to save as much digitised cultural heritage during the 2022 invasion\
  \ of Ukraine before the servers hosting them get destroyed, damaged or go offline\
  \ for any other reason. The web archives were created using the tools of the Webrecorder\
  \ Open Source project in the open WACZ format: https://webrecorder.github.io/wacz-spec/1.1.1/.\
  \ WACZ files are zipped containers of WARC (Web Archive Format) files enriched with\
  \ metadata, which can contain several crawls in a single file. The file sizes can\
  \ range from a few MBs to several TBs.\n"
