Name: OPERA Land Surface Disturbance Alert from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 provisional product (Version 0)
Description: "The OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS Version 0 data product was decommissioned
  on April 25, 2025. Users are encouraged to use the [OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS V1](https://doi.org/10.5067/SNWG/OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS_V1.001)
  data product which was released on March 14, 2024, and has achieved stage 1 validation.\n\nThe
  Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Land Surface
  Disturbance Alert from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) provisional data product
  Version 0 maps vegetation disturbance alerts from data collected by Landsat 8 and
  Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C
  Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). Vegetation disturbance alert is detected at 30
  meter (m) spatial resolution when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover
  within an HLS pixel. The product also provides auxiliary generic disturbance information
  as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the HLS scenes to provide
  information about more general disturbance trends. HLS data represent the highest
  temporal frequency data available at medium spatial resolution. The combined observations
  will provide greater sensitivity to land changes, whether of large magnitude/short
  duration, or small magnitude/long duration. \n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS (or
  DIST-ALERT) data product is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and
  each layer is distributed as a separate file. There are 19 layers contained within
  in the DIST-ALERT product: vegetation disturbance status, current vegetation cover
  indicator, current vegetation anomaly value, historical vegetation cover indicator,
  max vegetation anomaly value, vegetation disturbance confidence layer, date of initial
  vegetation disturbance, number of detected vegetation loss anomalies, and vegetation
  disturbance duration. See the Product Specification for a more detailed description
  of the individual layers provided in the DIST-ALERT product. \n\nKnown Issues\n*
  Additional usage constraints are provided under Section 5 of the Algorithm Theoretical
  Basis Document (ATBD).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this
