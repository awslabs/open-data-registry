Description: 'OpenCRAVAT is a module variant annotation tool developed by KarchinLab
  at Johns Hopkins.

  This dataset is a mirror of the OpenCRAVAT store available at https://store.opencravat.org.

  You can configure OpenCRAVAT to use this mirror by editing the "cravat-system.yml"
  file.

  The path to this file is in the first output line of the command "oc config system".
  In that file,

  change the value of "store_url" to "https://opencravat-store-aws.s3.amazonaws.com".
