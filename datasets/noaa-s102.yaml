Name: NOAA S-102 Bathymetric Surface Data
Description: S-102 is a data and metadata encoding specification that is part of the [S-100 Universal Hydrographic Data Model](https://iho.int/en/s100-project), an international standard for hydrographic data exchange. This collection of data contains bathymetric surfaces from [NOAA/NOS/OCS National Bathymetric Source](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/updates/building-the-national-bathymetry/), for various U.S. coastal and offshore waters and the great lakes. These datasets are encoded as HDF5 files conforming to the S-102 specification.
