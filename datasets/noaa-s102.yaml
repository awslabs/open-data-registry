Description: S-102 is a data and metadata encoding specification that is part of the
  [S-100 Universal Hydrographic Data Model](https://iho.int/en/s100-project), an international
  standard for hydrographic data exchange. This collection of data contains bathymetric
  surfaces from [NOAA/NOS/OCS National Bathymetric Source](https://nauticalcharts.noaa.gov/updates/building-the-national-bathymetry/),
  for various U.S. coastal and offshore waters and the great lakes. These datasets
  are encoded as HDF5 files conforming to the S-102 specification.
