  - Description: The Consented Activities of People (CAP) dataset is a fine grained activity dataset for visual AI research curated using the [Visym Collector](https://www.visym.com/collector/) platform. The CAP dataset contains annotated videos of [fine-grained activity classes](https://github.com/visym/cap/blob/main/classification/cap_labels.csv) of consented people. Videos are annotated with bounding box tracks around the primary actor along with temporal start/end frames for each activity instance, and distributed in [vipy](https://visym.github.io/vipy/vipy/) json format.
