Name: SpaceNet
Description: |
  SpaceNet, launched in August 2016 as an open innovation project offering a repository of freely available
  imagery with co-registered map features. Before SpaceNet, computer vision researchers had   minimal options
  to obtain free, precision-labeled, and high-resolution satellite imagery. Today, SpaceNet hosts datasets
  developed by its own team, along with data sets from projects like IARPAâ€™s Functional Map of the World (fMoW).
