Name: MODIS/Terra Net Evapotranspiration 8-Day L4 Global 500m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The MOD16A2 Version 6.1 Evapotranspiration/Latent Heat Flux product
  is an 8-day composite dataset produced at 500 meter (m) pixel resolution. The algorithm
  used for the MOD16 data product collection is based on the logic of the Penman-Monteith
  equation, which includes inputs of daily meteorological reanalysis data along with
  Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remotely sensed data products
  such as vegetation property dynamics, albedo, and land cover. \n\nProvided in the
  MOD16A2 product are layers for composited Evapotranspiration (ET), Latent Heat Flux
  (LE), Potential ET (PET) and Potential LE (PLE) along with a quality control layer.
  Two low resolution browse images, ET and LE, are also available for each MOD16A2
  granule.\n\nThe pixel values for the two Evapotranspiration layers (ET and PET)
  are the sum of all eight days within the composite period and the pixel values for
  the two Latent Heat layers (LE and PLE) are the average of all eight days within
  the composite period. Note that the last acquisition period of each year is a 5
  or 6-day composite period, depending on the year.\n\nKnown Issues\n* Operational
  and uncertainty issues are provided under Section 3 in the User Guide.\n* For complete
  information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment
  website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\n*
  The product uses Climatology LAI/FPAR as back up to the operational LAI/FPAR.\nRead
