Name: Open-Meteo Weather API Database
Description: |
  Open-Meteo integrates weather models from reputable national weather services, offering a swift and efficient weather API. Real-time weather forecasts are unified into a time-series database that provides historical and future weather data for any location worldwide.

  Through Open-Meteo on AWS Open Data, you can download the Open-Meteo weather database and analysis weather data locally. Docker images are provided to download data and to expose an HTTP API endpoint. Using Open-Meteo SDKs, you can seamlessly integrate weather data into your Python, Typescript, Swift, Kotlin, or Java applications.

  The entire source code is open-source, and contributions are welcome!

  To get started, familiarize yourself with the [available weather models](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-data) and explore tutorials on downloading 80 years of [historical weather data from ERA5](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-data/tree/main/tutorial_download_era5) or set up your own [real-time weather API](https://github.com/open-meteo/open-data/tree/main/tutorial_weather_api) with high-resolution models.
