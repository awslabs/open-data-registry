Name: NASA Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA)

Description: |
  NASA data for cosmic microwave background (CMB) analysis is made available here by the Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA), which is a part of NASA's High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC). LAMBDA hosts the data archives of over 30 different CMB missions spanning 30+ years. The data archive for each mission may contain a range of data types from low-level time-ordered data to high level science-ready products such as sky maps and angular power spectra. Also provided in consistent formats are a variety of full sky maps in complementary wavebands that are useful for CMB analysis, such as maps of radio synchrotron or infrared dust emission.
  <br/><br/>
  Data provided here are normally stored in the generic Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html)) format common in astronomy. Sky maps are generally provided in the Hierarchical Equal-Area isoLatitude Pixelization ([HEALPix](https://healpix.sourceforge.io/)) scheme, though the older COsmic Background Explorer (COBE) data is stored in COBE Quadrilateralizated Spherical Cube pixelization ([CSC](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/product/cobe/skymap_info_new.html)). See the links for each mission for more information on the data and how to use it. LAMBDA also provides user support, both generic and mission-specific, through a helpdesk available through the website's [Feedback page](https://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/contact/contact.html)."
