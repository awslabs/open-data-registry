Name: National Cancer Institute Center for Cancer Research - Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) Genomics and Expression
Description: |
  The study describes integrative analysis of genetic lesions in 574 diffuse large B cell lymphomas
  (DLBCL) involving exome and transcriptome sequencing, array-based DNA copy number analysis and
  targeted amplicon resequencing. The dataset contains open RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification
  data.
