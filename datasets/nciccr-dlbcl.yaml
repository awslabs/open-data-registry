Description: 'The study describes integrative analysis of genetic lesions in 574 diffuse
  large B cell lymphomas

  (DLBCL) involving exome and transcriptome sequencing, array-based DNA copy number
  analysis and

  targeted amplicon resequencing. The dataset contains open RNA-Seq Gene Expression
  Quantification

  data.
