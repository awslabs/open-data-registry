Name: Sleep Recordings from Wearable Devices in Meditators
Description: >
  This dataset supports a prospective cohort study evaluating the effects of advanced meditation on sleep quality
  and brain aging. Using EEG data from Dreem headbands worn by participants before and after a 4-day silent
  meditation retreat at the Isha Institute of Inner Sciences, researchers analyzed Brain Age Index (BAI)
  derived from sleep EEG and compared it across meditators and control groups. The study suggests meditation
  may contribute to healthier sleep and reduced brain aging.
