Name: "NEOWISE Post-Cryo Data | Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)"
Description: 'The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was a NASA Medium Explorer satellite in low-Earth orbit that conducted an all-sky astronomical imaging survey over four infrared bands from 2010-2011. The NEOWISE Post-Cryo Data Release contains 3.4 and 4.6 micron (W1 and W2) imaging data that were acquired between 29 September 2010 and 1 February 2011 following the exhaustion of the inner and outer cryogen tanks.'
