Name: GRAF Reforecast
Description: A zarr-formatted dataset of 1836 reforecast cases (~5 years) from The Weather Company GRAF (Global high-Resolution Atmospheric Forecasting) model, a version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Model for Predictions Across Scales (MPAS).  GRAF is global, but the configuration for this reforecast had a mesh refinement to ~4 km over the US, Caribbean Basin, and Europe, and 15 km elsewhere. This model was designed to run much of its computation on graphical processing units, with this development assisted by NVIDIA.  The 1836 cases (~5 years) were generated from ECMWF reanalyses (ERA5) for initial condition dates spanning more than 20 years, 2004-2024.  These dates of the chosen initial conditions mostly selected based on high-impact weather in the contiguous US (CONUS) and Caribbean.   Sampling in this way spanned a wider range of interesting, high-impact weather scenarios than were there five contiguous years of data. GRAF reforecasts were mostly run to +27 h lead time, assuming a 3-h for spin up followed by a full diurnal cycle.   Data were saved in zarr format on the native model vertical coordinate.   Most fields were saved at 15-min intervals, though several precipitation variables were saved at 5-min cadence.
