Name: MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo
Description: The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV&nbsp;database
  is comprised&nbsp;of&nbsp;deidentified electronic health records for patients admitted
  to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Access to MIMIC-IV is limited to credentialed
  users. Here, we have provided an openly-available demo of MIMIC-IV containing&nbsp;a
  subset of&nbsp;100 patients. The dataset includes similar content to MIMIC-IV, but
  excludes free-text clinical notes. The demo may be useful for running workshops&nbsp;and
  for&nbsp;assessing whether the MIMIC-IV is appropriate for a study before making
  an access request.
