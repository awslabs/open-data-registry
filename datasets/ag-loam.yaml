Name: AG-LOAM Dataset
Description: |
  AG-LOAM dataset has been released to facilitate the evaluation of LiDAR-based odometry algorithms in agricultural environments.
  1) It was collected by a wheeled mobile robot at the Agricultural Experimental Station of the University of California, Riverside, during Winter 2022 and Winter 2023.
  2) It provides LiDAR point cloud data captured using a Velodyne VLP-16 sensor, along with ground-truth trajectories obtained from an RTK-GPS system.
  3) It consists of 18 sequences collected over three phases, covering diverse planting environments, terrain conditions, path patterns, and robot motion profiles.
  4) It spans a total operation time of 3 hours, covers a total distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 150 GB of data.
