Name: NIFS Large Helical Device (LHD) Experiment
Description: The Large Helical Device (LHD), owned and operated by the National Institute for Fusion Science (NIFS), is one of the world's largest plasma confinement device which employs a heliotron magnetic configuration generated by the superconducting coils. The objectives are to conduct academic research on the confinement of steady-state, high-temperature, high-density plasmas, core plasma physics, and fusion reactor engineering, which are necessary to develop future fusion reactors. All the archived data of the LHD plasma diagnostics are available since the beginning of the LHD experiment, started on 31st of March, 1998.
