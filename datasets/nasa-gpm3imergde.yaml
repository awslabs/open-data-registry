Name: GPM IMERG Early Precipitation L3 1 day 0.1 degree x 0.1 degree V07 (GPM_3IMERGDE)
  at GES DISC
Description: "Version 07 is the current version of the data set. Older versions will
  no longer be available and have been superseded by Version 07.\n\nThe Integrated
  Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) IMERG is a NASA product estimating global
  surface precipitation rates at a high resolution of 0.1° every half-hour beginning
  2000.  It is part of the joint NASA-JAXA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)
  mission, using the GPM Core Observatory satellite as the standard to combine precipitation
  observations from an international constellation of satellites using advanced techniques.
  \ IMERG can be used for global-scale applications as well as over regions with sparse
  or no reliable surface observations.  The fine spatial and temporal resolution of
  IMERG data allows them to be accumulated to the scale of the application for increased
  skill.  IMERG has three Runs with varying latencies in response to a range of application
  needs: rapid-response applications (Early Run, 4-h latency), same/next-day applications
  (Late Run, 14-h latency), and post-real-time research (Final Run, 3.5-month latency).
  \ While IMERG strives for consistency and accuracy, satellite estimates of precipitation
  are expected to have lower skill over frozen surfaces, complex terrain, and coastal
  zones.  As well, the changing GPM satellite constellation over time may introduce
  artifacts that affect studies focusing on multi-year changes.\n\nThis dataset is
  the GPM Level 3 IMERG  *Early* Daily  10 x 10 km (GPM_3IMERGDE) derived from the
  half-hourly GPM_3IMERGHHE. The derived result represents an early (expedited) estimate
  of the daily mean precipitation rate in mm/day. The dataset is produced by first
  computing the mean precipitation rate in (mm/hour) in every grid cell, and then
  multiplying the result by 24.  This minimizes the possible dry bias in versions
  before \"07\", in the simple daily totals  for cells where less than 48 half-hourly
  observations are valid for the day. The latter under-sampling is very rare in the
  combined microwave-infrared (and rain gauge in the final) dataset, variable \"precipitation\",
  \ and appears in higher latitudes. Thus, in most cases users of global \"precipitation\"
  data will not notice any difference. This correction, however, is noticeable in
  the high-quality microwave retrieval, variable \"MWprecipitation\", where the occurrence
  of less than 48 valid half-hourly samples per day is very common. The counts of
  the valid half-hourly samples per day have always been provided as a separate variable,
  and users of daily data were advised to pay close attention to that variable and
  use it to calculate the correct precipitation daily rates. Starting with version
  \"07\", this is done in production to minimize possible misinterpretations of the
  data. The counts are still provided in the data, but they are only given to gauge
  the significance of the daily rates, and reconstruct the simple totals if someone
  wishes to do so. \n\nThe latency of the derived Early daily product is a couple
  of minutes after the last granule of GPM_3IMERGHHE for the UTC data day is received
  at GES DISC. Since the target latency of GPM_3IMERGHHE is 4 hours, the daily should
  appear about 4 hours after the closure of the UTC day. For information on the original
  data (GPM_3IMERGHHE), please see the Documentation (Related URL). \n\nThe daily
  mean rate (mm/day) is derived by first computing the mean precipitation rate (mm/hour)
  in a grid cell for the data day, and then multiplying the result by 24.  Thus, for
  every grid cell we have                \n\nPdaily_mean     = SUM{Pi * 1[Pi valid]}
  / Pdaily_cnt  * 24, i=[1,Nf]\n\nWhere:\nPdaily_cnt = SUM{1[Pi valid]}\n\nPi              -
  half-hourly input, in (mm/hr)\nNf              - Number of half-hourly files per
  day, Nf=48\n1[.]            - Indicator function; 1 when Pi is valid, 0 otherwise\nPdaily_cnt
  \     - Number of valid retrievals in a grid cell per day.\n\nGrid cells for which
  Pdaily_cnt=0, are set to fill value in the Daily files.\nNote that Pi=0 is a valid
  value.\n\nPdaily_cnt are provided in the data files as variables \"precipitation_cnt\"
  and \"MWprecipitation_cnt\", for correspondingly the microwave-IR-gauge and microwave-only
  retrievals. They are only given to gauge the significance of the daily rates, and
  reconstruct the simple totals if someone wishes to do so. \n\nThere are various
  ways the daily error could be estimated from the source half-hourly random error
  (variable \"randomError\"). The daily error provided in the data files is calculated
  in a fashion similar to the daily mean precipitation rate. First, the mean of the
  squared half-hourly \"randomError\"  for the day is computed, and the resulting
  (mm^2/hr) is converted to (mm^2/day). Finally, square root is taken to get the result
  in (mm/day):\n\nPerr_daily = { SUM{ (Perr_i)^2 * 1[Perr_i valid] ) } / Ncnt_err
  \ * 24}^0.5, i=[1,Nf]\nNcnt_err   = SUM( 1[Perr_i valid] )\n\nwhere:\nPerr_i\t\t-
  half-hourly input, \"randomError\", (mm/hr)\nPerr_daily\t- Magnitude of the daily
  error, (mm/day)\nNcnt_err\t\t- Number of valid half-hour error estimates\n\nAgain,
  the sum of squared \"randomError\" can be reconstructed, and other estimates can
  be derived using the available counts in the Daily files.\n\n\nRead our doc on how
