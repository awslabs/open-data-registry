Description: "The NOAA National Water Model Retrospective dataset contains input and\
  \ output from multi-decade CONUS retrospective simulations. These simulations used\
  \ meteorological input fields from meteorological retrospective datasets. The output\
  \ frequency and fields available in this historical NWM dataset differ from those\
  \ contained in the real-time operational NWM forecast model.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOne\
  \ application of this dataset is to provide historical context to current near real-time\
  \ streamflow, soil moisture and snowpack conditions. The retrospective data can\
  \ be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses with hourly streamflow\
  \ output and 3-hourly land surface output. This dataset can also be used in the\
  \ development of end user applications which require a long baseline of data for\
  \ system training or verification purposes. <br />\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrently there\
  \ are three versions of the NWM retrospective dataset\n<br/>\n<br/>\nA 42-year (February\
  \ 1979 through December 2020) retrospective simulation using version 2.1 of the\
  \ National Water Model.\nA 26-year (January 1993 through December 2018) retrospective\
  \ simulation using version 2.0 of the National Water Model.\nA 25-year (January\
  \ 1993 through December 2017) retrospective simulation using version 1.2 of the\
  \ National Water Model.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nVersion 2.1 uses forcings from the Office\
  \ of Water Prediction Analysis of Record for Calibration (AORC) dataset while Version\
  \ 2.0 and version 1.2 use input meteorological forcing from the North American Land\
  \ Data Assimilation (NLDAS) data set. Note that no streamflow or other data assimilation\
  \ is performed within any of the NWM retrospective simulations.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
  NWM Retrospective data is available in two formats, NetCDF and Zarr.  The NetCDF\
  \ files contain the full set of NWM output data, while the Zarr files contain a\
  \ subset of NWM output fields that vary with model version. \n<br/>\n<br/>\nNWM\
  \ V2.1:  All model output and forcing input fields are available in the NetCDF format.\
  \  All model output fields along with the precipitation forcing field are available\
  \ in the Zarr format.\nNWM V2.0:  All model output fields are available in NetCDF\
  \ format. Model channel output including streamflow and related fields are available\
  \ in Zarr format.\nNWM V1.2:  All model output fields are available in NetCDF format.\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\nA table listing the data available within each NetCDF and Zarr file\
  \ is located in the '[documentation page](https://github.com/NOAA-Big-Data-Program/bdp-data-docs/blob/main/nwm/README.md)'.\
  \  This data includes meteorological NWM forcing inputs along with NWM hydrologic\
  \ and land surface outputs, and varies by version number. \n"
