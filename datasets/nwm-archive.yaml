Name: NOAA National Water Model Reanalysis
Description: |
  The NOAA National Water Model Reanalysis dataset contains output
  from multi-decade retrospective simulations. These
  simulations used observed rainfall as input and ingested other
  required meteorological input fields from a weather reanalysis
  dataset. The output frequency and fields available in this
  historical NWM dataset differ from those contained in the
  real-time forecast model. One application of this dataset is
  to provide historical context to current real-time streamflow,
  soil moisture and snowpack NWM conditions. The reanalysis data
  can be used to infer flow frequencies and perform temporal analyses
  with hourly streamflow output and 3-hourly land surface output. The
  long-term dataset can also be used in the development of end user
  applications which require a long baseline of data for system
  training or verification purposes. This dataset contains output from two
  retrospective simulations.  Currently there are two versions of the dataset:
  A 25-year (January 1993 through December 2017) retrospective simulation using
  version 1.2 of the National Water Model, and a 26-year (January 1993 through
   December 2018) retrospective simulation using version 2.0
   of the National Water Model.
