Name: ERA5 Cloud Optimized (Zarr + Icechunk)
ShortDescription: >
  A cloud-optimized version of the NSF NCAR Curated ERA5 dataset. Provided in Zarr + Icechunk,
  this version enables efficient, scalable access to global reanalysis data for weather, climate,
  and ML/AI applications. Managed by Earthmover.
Description: >
  This dataset is a cloud-optimized reformat of the NSF NCAR Curated ECMWF Reanalysis 5 (ERA5).  
  While the NCAR-hosted dataset is provided in CF-compliant NetCDF4 files, this version has been  
  restructured into Zarr format with Icechunk indexing, making it highly scalable and performant  
  for cloud-native workloads. This enables efficient, chunked access to time series and spatial  
  subsets without requiring full file downloads.  

  ERA5 itself is produced using high-resolution forecasts (HRES) at 31 km resolution and a 62 km  
  resolution ten-member 4D-Var ensemble of data assimilation (EDA) in CY41r2 of ECMWFâ€™s Integrated  
  Forecast System (IFS) with 137 hybrid sigma-pressure levels up to 0.01 hPa. Atmospheric data are  
  interpolated to 37 pressure levels, with surface and single-level parameters (e.g., precipitation,  
  2 m temperature, radiation fluxes, soil and ocean-wave model fields). Data are generally available  
  at hourly frequency, consisting of analyses and short (12-hour) forecasts initialized at 06 and 18 UTC.  

  ERA5 products are widely used for ML/AI training, climate and weather research, and applications  
  such as renewable energy siting.
