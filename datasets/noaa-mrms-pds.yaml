  Description: "The MRMS system was developed to produce severe weather, transportation,\
    \ and precipitation products for improved decision-making capability to improve\
    \ hazardous weather forecasts and warnings, along with hydrology, aviation, and\
    \ numerical weather prediction.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMRMS is a system with fully-automated\
    \ algorithms that quickly and intelligently integrate data streams from multiple\
    \ radars, surface and upper air observations, lightning detection systems, satellite\
    \ observations, and forecast models. Numerous two-dimensional multiple-sensor\
    \ products offer assistance for hail, wind, tornado, quantitative precipitation\
    \ estimations, convection, icing, and turbulence diagnosis.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMRMS\
    \ is being used to develop and test new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)\
    \ NextGen products in addition to advancing techniques in quality control, icing\
    \ detection, and turbulence in collaboration with the National Center for Atmospheric\
    \ Research, the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, and Lincoln Laboratories.\n\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nMRMS was deployed operationally in 2014 at the National Center for\
    \ Environmental Prediction (NCEP). All of the 100+ products it produces are available\
    \ via NCEP to all of the WFOs, RFCs, CWSUs and NCEP service centers. In addition,\
    \ the MRMS product suite is publicly available to any other entity who wishes\
    \ to access and use the data. Other federal agencies that use MRMS include FEMA,\
    \ DOD, FAA, and USDA.\n<br/>\n<br/>  \nMRMS is the proposed operational version\
    \ of the WDSS-II and NMQ research systems.\n<br/>\n<br/> \nThe MRMS system was\
    \ jointly developed in cooperation with the Cooperative Institute for Severe and\
    \ High-Impact Weather Research and Operations (CIWRO) (formerly CIMMS), and the\
    \ University of Oklahoma retains the right to commercially license the software.\
    \ Several leading weather information companies have previously licensed the MRMS\
    \ system from the University of Oklahoma for commercial use, although the software\
    \ is available for government at no cost.\n<br/>\n", Documentation: 'https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/',
