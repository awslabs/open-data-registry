Name: Umbra Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Open Data
Description: Umbra satellites generate the highest resolution SAR imagery ever offered commercially from space (better than 25 cm / 10 inches). SAR satellites can capture images at night, through cloud cover, smoke and rain. SAR is unique in its abilities to monitor changes. The Open Data Program (ODP) monitors ten diverse locations around the world. Updated frequently with new images. ODP enables users to analyze the time-series data to detect changes in each location. If you have a suggestion for a new location, feedback on the dataset, or any questions, contact us at umbra.space/open-data.
