Name: Atmospheric Models from Météo-France
Description: |
  Global and high-resolution regional atmospheric models from Météo-France.

  - ARPEGE World covers the entire world at a base horizontal resolution of 0.5° (~55km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up to 114 hours in the future.

  - ARPEGE Europe covers Europe and North-Africa at a base horizontal resolution of 0.1° (~11km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up to 114 hours in the future.

  - AROME France covers France at a base horizontal resolution of 0.025° (~2.5km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up to 42 hours in the future.

  - AROME France HD covers France and neigborhood at a base horizontal resolution of 0.01° (~1.5km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up to 42 hours in the future.

  Dozens of atmospheric variables are available through this datase: temperatures, winds, precipitation...
