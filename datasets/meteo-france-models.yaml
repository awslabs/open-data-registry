Description: "Global and high-resolution regional atmospheric models from M\xE9t\xE9\
  o-France.\n\n- ARPEGE World covers the entire world at a base horizontal resolution\
  \ of 0.5\xB0 (~55km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up to 114 hours\
  \ in the future.\n\n- ARPEGE Europe covers Europe and North-Africa at a base horizontal\
  \ resolution of 0.1\xB0 (~11km) between grid points, it predicts weather out up\
  \ to 114 hours in the future.\n\n- AROME France covers France at a base horizontal\
  \ resolution of 0.025\xB0 (~2.5km) between grid points, it predicts weather out\
  \ up to 42 hours in the future.\n\n- AROME France HD covers France and neighborhood\
  \ at a base horizontal resolution of 0.01\xB0 (~1.5km) between grid points, it predicts\
  \ weather out up to 42 hours in the future.\n\nDozens of atmospheric variables are\
  \ available through this datase: temperatures, winds, precipitation...\n\nOur work\
  \ is based on open-data from M\xE9t\xE9o-France, but we are not affiliated or endorsed\
  \ by M\xE9t\xE9o-France.\n"
