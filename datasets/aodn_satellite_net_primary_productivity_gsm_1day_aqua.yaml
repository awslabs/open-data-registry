Name: Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Net Primary Productivity (GSM model
  and Eppley-VGPM algorithm)
Description: "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight\
  \ reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral\
  \ measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most\
  \ typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. Modelling is then used to\
  \ compute an estimate of the Net Primary Productivity (NPP).\n\nThe model used is\
  \ based on the standard vertically generalised production model (VGPM).  The VGPM\
  \ is a \"chlorophyll-based\" model that estimates net primary production from chlorophyll\
  \ using a temperature-dependent description of chlorophyll-specific        photosynthetic\
  \ efficiency. For the VGPM, net primary production is a function of chlorophyll,\
  \ available light, and the photosynthetic efficiency. The only difference between\
  \ the Standard VGPM and the Eppley-VGPM is the temperature-dependent description\
  \ of photosynthetic efficiencies, with the Eppley approach using an exponential\
  \ function to account for variation in photosynthetic efficiencies due to photoacclimation.\
  \ The similarity between these models (VGPM vs E_VGPM) is described more extensively\
  \ in a paper by Elena-Carr et al (2006.). VGPM is a Depth Integrated Model(DIM)\
  \ described by Behrenfeld and Falkowski (1997), with modification due to Eppley\
  \ (1972) as implemented by Antoine and Morel (1996).\n\nThere are multiple retrieval\
  \ algorithms for estimating Chl-a. These data (eppley_npp_chl_gsm) use the Garver-Siegel-Maritorena\
  \ (GSM) method implemented in the SeaDAS processing software l2gen and described\
  \ in \u201CChapter 11, and references therein, of IOCCG Report 5, 2006, (http://ioccg.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ioccg-report-05.pdf).\
  \ This product is recommended for use in the VGPM model. The product Eppley_NPP_chl_gsm\
  \ is experimental, in the sense that it is challenging to validate due to the scarcity\
  \ of insitu measurments. It should only be used with caution informed by understanding\
  \ of the algorithms."
