    ', Description: "One of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency\u2019s (NGA)\
    \ and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) missions\
    \ is to ensure the safety of navigation on the seas by \nmaintaining the most\
    \ current information and the highest quality services for U.S. and global transport\
    \ networks. To achieve this mission, we need accurate coastal bathymetry over\
    \ diverse \nenvironmental conditions. The SCuBA program focused on providing critical\
    \ information to improve existing bathymetry resources and techniques with two\
    \ specific objectives. The first objective \nwas to validate National Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Ice, Cloud and land Elevation SATellite-2\
    \ (ICESat-2), an Earth observing, space-based light detection and ranging (LiDAR)\
    \ \ncapability, as a useful bathymetry tool for nearshore bathymetry information\
    \ in differing environmental conditions. Upon validating the ICESat-2 bathymetry\
    \ retrievals relative to sea floor \ntype, water clarity, and water surface dynamics,\
    \ the next objective is to use ICESat-2 as a calibration tool to improve existing\
    \ Satellite Derived Bathymetry (SDB) coastal bathymetry products \nwith poor coastal\
    \ depth information but superior spatial coverage. Current resources that monitor\
    \ coastal bathymetry can have large vertical depth errors (up to 50 percent) in\
    \ the nearshore \nregion; however, derived results from ICESat-2 shows promising\
    \ results for improving the accuracy of the bathymetry information in the nearshore\
    \ region.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Project Overview**\n<br/>\nOne of NGA\u2019s and NOAA\u2019\
    s primary missions is to provide safety of navigation information.  However, coastal\
    \ depth information is still lacking in some regions\u2014specifically, remote\
    \ regions. In fact, it has been reported that 80 percent of the entire seafloor\
    \ has not been mapped. Traditionally, airborne LiDARs and survey boats are used\
    \ to map the seafloor, but in remote areas, we have to rely on satellite capabilities,\
    \ which currently lack the vertical accuracy desired to support safety of navigation\
    \ in shallow water. In 2018, NASA launched a space-based LiDAR system called ICESat-2\
    \ that has global coverage and a polar orbit originally designed to monitor the\
    \ ice elevation in polar regions. Remarkably, because it has a green laser beam,\
    \ ICESat-2 also happens to collect bathymetry information [ICESat-2](nasa.gov).\
    \ With algorithm development provided by University of Texas (UT) Austin, NGA\
    \ Research and Development (R&D) leveraged the ICESat-2 platform to generate SCuBA,\
    \ an automated depth retrieval algorithm for accurate, global, refraction-corrected\
    \ underwater depths from 0 m to 30 m, detailed in Figure 1 of the documentation.\
    \ The key benefit of this product is the vertical depth accuracy of depth retrievals,\
    \ which is ideal for a calibration tool.  NGA and NOAA National Geodetic Survey\
    \ (NGS), partnered to make this product available to the public for all US territories.\n\
