Description: 'The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is an international
  collaboration of

  research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).
  The goal

  of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human
  genome,

  including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements
  that

  control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators
  employ a

  variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and
  annotation

  of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA
  sources,

  comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory

  elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays
  of

  DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA
  and RNA,

  i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and

  RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.
