Name: Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
Description: |
  The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) Consortium is an international collaboration of
  research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). The goal
  of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of functional elements in the human genome,
  including elements that act at the protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that
  control cells and circumstances in which a gene is active. ENCODE investigators employ a
  variety of assays and methods to identify functional elements. The discovery and annotation
  of gene elements is accomplished primarily by sequencing a diverse range of RNA sources,
  comparative genomics, integrative bioinformatic methods, and human curation. Regulatory
  elements are typically investigated through DNA hypersensitivity assays, assays of
  DNA methylation, and immunoprecipitation (IP) of proteins that interact with DNA and RNA,
  i.e., modified histones, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and
  RNA-binding proteins, followed by sequencing.
