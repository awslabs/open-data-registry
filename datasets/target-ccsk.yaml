Name: TARGET-CCSK open data
Description: |
  Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET) is the collaborative
  effort of a large, diverse consortium of extramural and NCI investigators. The goal of the effort
  is to accelerate molecular discoveries that drive the initiation and progression of hard-to-treat
  childhood cancers and facilitate rapid translation of those findings into the clinic.

  Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) is a rare kidney tumor that usually occurs in children age
  3 or younger.  TARGET-CCSK project provides comprehensive molecular characterization to determine
  the genetic changes that drive the initiation and progression of CCSK. The dataset contains open
  Clinical Supplement, Biospecimen Supplement, RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data from
  Genomic Data Commons (GDC), and open data from GDC Legacy Archive.
