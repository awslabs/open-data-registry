Description: XBT real-time data is available through the IMOS portal. Data is acquired
  by technicians who ride the ships of opportunity in order to perform high density
  sampling along well established transit lines. The data acquisition system used
  is the Quoll developed by Turo Technology. Data collected and is stored in netcdf
  files, with real-time data messages (JJVV bathy messages) created on the ship and
  sent to shore by iridium sbd. This is inserted onto the GTS by our colleagues at
  the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The full resolution data is collected from
  the ship and returned for processing to scientists at CSIRO in Hobart. It undergoes
  a full scientific QC process which identifies both bad data and oceanic features
  such as eddies, fronts and temperature inversions. Finally, the data is distributed
  to the GTSPP global data acquisition centre in Washington DC where it is made freely
  available to all. This SOOP dataset covers waters around Australia and across to
  New Zealand.
