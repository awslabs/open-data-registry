Name: New Jersey Statewide LiDAR
Description:  |
  Elevation datasets in New Jersey have been collected over several years as several
  discrete projects.  Each project covers a geographic area, which is a subsection of
  the entire state, and has differing specifications based on the available technology
  at the time and project budget.  The geographic extent of one project may overlap that
  of a neighboring project. Each of the 18 projects contains deliverable products such
  as LAS (Lidar point cloud) files, unclassified/classified, tiled to cover project area;
  relevant metadata records or documents, most adhering to the Federal Geographic Data
  Committeeâ€™s (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM); tiling
  index feature class or shapefile; flights lines feature class or shapefile; Digital
  Elevation Model in image format or Esri grid format; other derivative data products
  such as contour lines feature class or shapefile.
