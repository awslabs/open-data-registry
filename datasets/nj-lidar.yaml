Description: "Elevation datasets in New Jersey have been collected over several years\
  \ as several\ndiscrete projects.  Each project covers a geographic area, which is\
  \ a subsection of\nthe entire state, and has differing specifications based on the\
  \ available technology\nat the time and project budget.  The geographic extent of\
  \ one project may overlap that\nof a neighboring project. Each of the 18 projects\
  \ contains deliverable products such\nas LAS (Lidar point cloud) files, unclassified/classified,\
  \ tiled to cover project area;\nrelevant metadata records or documents, most adhering\
  \ to the Federal Geographic Data\nCommittee\u2019s (FGDC) Content Standard for Digital\
  \ Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM); tiling\nindex feature class or shapefile; flights\
  \ lines feature class or shapefile; Digital\nElevation Model in image format or\
  \ Esri grid format; other derivative data products\nsuch as contour lines feature\
  \ class or shapefile.\n"
