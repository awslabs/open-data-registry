Name: Department of Energy's Marine Energy Data Lake 
Description: |
  Data released from projects funded by the Department of Energy's Water Power Technologies Office (DOE WPTO) 
  that are too large or complex to be conveniently accessed by traditional means. The Marine Energy data lake 
  aims to improve and automate access of high-value MHK data sets, making data actionable and discoverable by 
  researchers and industry to accelerate analysis and advance innovation. 
  This data lake is a sister-data lake to the Department of Energyâ€™s Open Energy Data Initiative (OEDI) data lake.
