Name: DAILY EAR BY RESERVOIR
Description: Stored Energy Data (EAR) on a daily basis by Reservoir. This quantity represents the energy associated with the volume of water stored in the reservoirs that can be converted into generation in the power plant itself and in all power plants downstream of the cascade. The magnitude of EAR considers the level verified in the reservoirs on the reference date. 
The maximum EAR magnitude is the storage capacity if all reservoirs were full. The EAR quantities for the downstream subsystem consider the use of water from the reservoir to produce energy in a power plant that is in a different subsystem
