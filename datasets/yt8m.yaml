Description: "This both the original .tfrecords and a Parquet representation of the\
  \ [YouTube 8 Million dataset](https://research.google.com/youtube8m/). YouTube-8M\
  \ is a large-scale labeled video dataset that consists of millions of YouTube video\
  \ IDs, with high-quality machine-generated annotations from a diverse vocabulary\
  \ of 3,800+ visual entities. It comes with precomputed audio-visual features from\
  \ billions of frames and audio segments, designed to fit on a single hard disk.\
  \ This dataset also includes the YouTube-8M Segments data from June 2019. \nThis\
  \ dataset is 'Lakehouse Ready'. Meaning, you can query this data in-place straight\
  \ out of the Registry of Open Data S3 bucket. [Deploy this dataset's corresponding\
  \ CloudFormation template](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https://aws-roda-ml-datalake.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/YT8MRodaTemplate.RodaTemplate.json&stackName=YT8M-RODA)\
  \ to create the  AWS Glue Catalog entries into your account in about 30 seconds.\
  \ That one step will enable you to interact with the data with AWS Athena, AWS SageMaker,\
  \ AWS EMR, or join into your AWS Redshift clusters. More detail in (the documentation)[https://github.com/aws-samples/data-lake-as-code/blob/roda-ml/README.md.\n"
