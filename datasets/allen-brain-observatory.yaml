Name: Allen Brain Observatory - Visual Coding AWS Public Data Set
Description: |
  The Allen Brain Observatory – Visual Coding is a large-scale, standardized survey of physiological activity across the mouse visual cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus. It includes datasets collected with both two-photon imaging and Neuropixels probes, two complementary techniques for measuring the activity of neurons in vivo. The two-photon imaging dataset features visually evoked calcium responses from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in a range of cortical layers, visual areas, and Cre lines. The Neuropixels dataset features spiking activity from distributed cortical and subcortical brain regions, collected under analogous conditions to the two-photon imaging experiments. We hope that experimentalists and modelers will use these comprehensive, open datasets as a testbed for theories of visual information processing.
