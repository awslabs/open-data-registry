    Title: "Use the Allen Brain Observatory \u2013 Visual Coding on AWS"
    URL: https://github.com/AllenInstitute/AllenSDK/wiki/Use-the-Allen-Brain-Observatory-%E2%80%93-Visual-Coding-on-AWS
Description: "The Allen Brain Observatory \u2013 Visual Coding is a large-scale, standardized\
  \ survey of physiological activity across the mouse visual cortex, hippocampus,\
  \ and thalamus. It includes datasets collected with both two-photon imaging and\
  \ Neuropixels probes, two complementary techniques for measuring the activity of\
  \ neurons in vivo. The two-photon imaging dataset features visually evoked calcium\
  \ responses from GCaMP6-expressing neurons in a range of cortical layers, visual\
  \ areas, and Cre lines. The Neuropixels dataset features spiking activity from distributed\
  \ cortical and subcortical brain regions, collected under analogous conditions to\
  \ the two-photon imaging experiments. We hope that experimentalists and modelers\
  \ will use these comprehensive, open datasets as a testbed for theories of visual\
  \ information processing.\n"
