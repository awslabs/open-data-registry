Name: 'Will Two Do? Varying Dimensions in Electrocardiography: The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2021'
Description: 'The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive representation of the
  electrical activity of the heart. Although the twelve-lead ECG is the standard diagnostic
  screening system for many cardiological issues, the limited accessibility of twelve-lead
  ECG devices provides a rationale for smaller, lower-cost, and easier to use devices.
  While single-lead ECGs are limiting [1], reduced-lead ECG systems hold promise,
  with evidence that subsets of the standard twelve leads can capture useful information
  [2], [3], [4] and even be comparable to twelve-lead ECGs in some limited contexts.
  In 2017 we challenged the public to classify AF from a single-lead ECG, and in 2020
  we challenged the public to diagnose a much larger number of cardiac problems using
  twelve-lead recordings. However, there is limited evidence to demonstrate the utility
  of reduced-lead ECGs for capturing a wide range of diagnostic information.


  In this year&rsquo;s Challenge, we ask the following question: &lsquo;Will two do?&rsquo;
  This year&rsquo;s Challenge builds on last year&rsquo;s Challenge [5], which asked
  participants to classify cardiac abnormalities from twelve-lead ECGs. We are asking
  you to build an algorithm that can classify cardiac abnormalities from twelve-lead,
  six-lead, four-lead, three-lead, and two-lead ECGs. We will test each algorithm
  on databases of these reduced-lead ECGs, and the differences in performances of
  the algorithms on these databases will reveal the utility of reduced-lead ECGs in
  comparison to standard twelve-lead EGCs.'
