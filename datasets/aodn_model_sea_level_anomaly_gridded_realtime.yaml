Description: "Gridded (adjusted) sea level anomaly (GSLA), gridded sea level (GSL)\
  \ and surface geostrophic velocity (UCUR,VCUR) for the Australasian region. GSLA\
  \ is mapped using optimal interpolation of detided, de-meaned, inverse-barometer-adjusted\
  \ altimeter and tidegauge estimates of sea level. GSL is GSLA plus an estimate of\
  \ the departure of mean sea level from the geoid \u2013 mean sea level (over 18\
  \ years of model time) of Ocean Forecasting Australia Model version 3 (OFAM3). The\
  \ geostrophic velocities are derived from GSLA and the mean surface velocity from\
  \ OFAM3. \n\n\nThe altimeter data window for input to the Delayed Mode (DM) maps\
  \ is symmetrical about the map date. The width of the window is dependent on the\
  \ number of altimeters flying at the time and ranges from 30 days to 14 days. The\
  \ altimeter data window for Near Real Time (NRT) maps is asymmetrical about the\
  \ analysis date (-21 to 4 days). For both NRT and DM, altimeter data is weighted\
  \ by the difference between the analysis date of the map and the time of each altimeter\
  \ observation.\n\nReferences: http://imos.aodn.org.au/oceancurrent"
