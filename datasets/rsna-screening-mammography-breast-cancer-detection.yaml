Name:  RSNA Screening Mammography Breast Cancer Detection (RSNA-SMBC) Dataset
Description: "According to the WHO, breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer worldwide. In 2020 alone, there were 2.3 million new breast cancer diagnoses and 685,000 deaths. Yet breast cancer mortality in high-income countries has dropped by 40% since the 1980s when health authorities implemented regular mammography screening in age groups considered at risk. Early detection and treatment are critical to reducing cancer fatalities, and your machine learning skills could help streamline the process radiologists use to evaluate screening mammograms. Currently, early detection of breast cancer requires the expertise of highly-trained human observers, making screening mammography programs expensive to conduct. RSNA collected screening mammograms and supporting information from two sites, totaling just under 20,000 imaging studies."
