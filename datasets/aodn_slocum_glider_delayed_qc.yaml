Description: The Australian National Facility for Ocean Gliders (ANFOG), with IMOS/NCRIS
  funding, deploys a fleet of eight gliders around Australia. The data represented
  by this record, are presented in delayed mode. The underwater ocean glider represents
  a technological revolution for oceanography. Autonomous ocean gliders can be built
  relatively cheaply, are controlled remotely and are reusable allowing them to make
  repeated subsurface ocean observations at a fraction of the cost of conventional
  methods. The data retrieved from the glider fleet will contribute to the study of
  the major boundary current systems surrounding Australia and their links to coastal
  ecosystems. The ANFOG glider fleet consists of two types; Slocum gliders and Seagliders.
  Slocum gliders (named for Joshua Slocum, the first solo global circumnavigator),
  manufactured by Webb Research Corp are optimised for shallow coastal waters (<200m)
  where high manoeuvrability is needed. ANFOG will have three Slocum gliders for deployment
  on the continental shelf. Seagliders, built at the University of Washington, are
  designed to operate more efficiently in the open ocean up to 1000m water depth.
  ANFOG uses their five Seagliders to monitor the boundary currents and continental
  shelves, which is valuable for gathering long-term environmental records of physical,
  chemical and biological data not widely measured to date. Whilst the Slocum gliders,
  due to their low cost and operational flexibility, will be of great use in intensive
  coastal monitoring, both types of gliders weigh only 52kg, enabling them to be launched
  from small boats. They have a suite of sensors able to record temperature, salinity,
  dissolved oxygen, turbidity, dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll against position
  and depth Sustained ocean observations will allow researchers to document the natural
  variability of the ocean, and better understand the effect of climate change on
  coastal ecosystems. The IMOS gliders will focus particularly on the major boundary
  currents that run down the Australian coast, the Leeuwin in the west and the East
  Australian Current (EAC). The study of these currents is critical for understanding
  the north-south transport of freshwater, heat and biogeochemical properties. The
  currents exert a large influence on coastal ecosystems, shipping lanes and fisheries.
