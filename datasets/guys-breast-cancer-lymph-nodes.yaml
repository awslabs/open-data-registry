Name: Guy's Breast Cancer Lymph Nodes (GRAPE)
Description: This is a retrospective dataset of 1523 H&E-stained whole slide images (WSI) of lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. The cohort consisted of 177 patients (122 LN-positive - metastasis was reported in at least 1 LN - and 55 LN-negative patients) with invasive breast carcinoma treated between 1984 and 2002 at Guy’s Hospital London, UK. Slides were scanned and digitised at 40x magnification (0.23 µm/pixel), NanoZoomer H.T2.0 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu Photonics UK, Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK). WSIs are in .ndpi format.
