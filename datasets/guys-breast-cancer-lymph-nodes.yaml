Description: "This is a retrospective dataset of 1523 H&E-stained whole slide images\
  \ (WSI) of lymph nodes from breast cancer patients. The cohort consisted of 177\
  \ patients (122 LN-positive - metastasis was reported in at least 1 LN - and 55\
  \ LN-negative patients) with invasive breast carcinoma treated between 1984 and\
  \ 2002 at Guy\u2019s Hospital London, UK. Slides were scanned and digitised at 40x\
  \ magnification (0.23 \xB5m/pixel), NanoZoomer H.T2.0 2.0-HT (Hamamatsu Photonics\
  \ UK, Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK). WSIs are in .ndpi format."
