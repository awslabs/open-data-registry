Name: Terra Fusion Data Sampler
Description: Terra is the flagship of NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS). It was launched into orbit on December 18, 1999 and carries five instruments: the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), and the Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT).  The Terra Basic Fusion dataset is an easy-to-access record of the changes observed by all the instruments on the Terra mission for selected areas (described below) covering the years 2000-2015.
