Name: Terra Fusion Data Sampler
Description: |
  The Terra Basic Fusion dataset is a fused dataset of the original Level 1 radiances
  from the five Terra instruments. They have been fully validate to contain the original
  Terra instrument Level 1 data. Each Level 1 Terra Basic Fusion file contains one full
  Terra orbit of data and is typically 15 – 40 GB in size, depending on how much data was
  collected for that orbit. It contains instrument radiance in physical units; radiance
  quality indicator; geolocation for each IFOV at its native resolution; sun-view geometry;
  bservation time; and other attributes/metadata. It is stored in HDF5, conformed to CF
  conventions, and accessible by netCDF-4 enhanced models. It’s naming convention
  follows: TERRA_BF_L1B_OXXXX_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_F000_V000.h5. A concise description of the
  dataset, along with links to complete documentation and available software tools, can
  be found on the Terra Fusion project page: https://terrafusion.web.illinois.edu.</br></br>

  Terra is the flagship satellite of NASA’s Earth Observing System (EOS). It was launched
  into orbit on December 18, 1999 and carries five instruments. These are the
  Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle Imaging
  SpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
  Radiometer (ASTER), the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), and the
  Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT).</br></br>

  The Terra Basic Fusion dataset is an easy-to-access record of the Level 1 radiances
  for instruments on the Terra mission for selected WRS-2 paths covering the years
  2000-2015. These paths are Paths 20-26 (e.g., US corn belt), 108 (e.g., Japan),
  125 (e.g., China), 143 (e.g., India), 150 (e.g., Showa Station, Antarctica),
  169 (e.g., Europe and Africa), 188 (e.g., Nigeria calibration site), and 233
  (e.g., Greenland).
