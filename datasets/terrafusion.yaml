Description: "The Terra Basic Fusion dataset is a fused dataset of the original Level\
  \ 1 radiances\nfrom the five Terra instruments. They have been fully validate to\
  \ contain the original\nTerra instrument Level 1 data. Each Level 1 Terra Basic\
  \ Fusion file contains one full\nTerra orbit of data and is typically 15 \u2013\
  \ 40 GB in size, depending on how much data was\ncollected for that orbit. It contains\
  \ instrument radiance in physical units; radiance\nquality indicator; geolocation\
  \ for each IFOV at its native resolution; sun-view geometry;\nbservation time; and\
  \ other attributes/metadata. It is stored in HDF5, conformed to CF\nconventions,\
  \ and accessible by netCDF-4 enhanced models. It\u2019s naming convention\nfollows:\
  \ TERRA_BF_L1B_OXXXX_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_F000_V000.h5. A concise description of the\n\
  dataset, along with links to complete documentation and available software tools,\
  \ can\nbe found on the Terra Fusion project page: https://terrafusion.web.illinois.edu.</br></br>\n\
  \nTerra is the flagship satellite of NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System (EOS). It\
  \ was launched\ninto orbit on December 18, 1999 and carries five instruments. These\
  \ are the\nModerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Multi-angle\
  \ Imaging\nSpectroRadiometer (MISR), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and\
  \ Reflection\nRadiometer (ASTER), the Clouds and Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System\
  \ (CERES), and the\nMeasurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT).</br></br>\n\
  \nThe Terra Basic Fusion dataset is an easy-to-access record of the Level 1 radiances\n\
  for instruments on the Terra mission for selected WRS-2 paths covering the years\n\
  2000-2015. These paths are Paths 20-26 (e.g., US corn belt), 108 (e.g., Japan),\n\
  125 (e.g., China), 143 (e.g., India), 150 (e.g., Showa Station, Antarctica),\n169\
  \ (e.g., Europe and Africa), 188 (e.g., Nigeria calibration site), and 233\n(e.g.,\
  \ Greenland).\n"
