Description: >
  A user-generated geospatial data collection maintained by the Data to Science 
  platform. Contributions vary by project, but typically include cloud-optimized 
  datasets such as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) and Cloud-Optimized Point 
  Clouds (COPCs), designed for efficient streaming, visualization, and analysis 
  in modern geospatial applications.
