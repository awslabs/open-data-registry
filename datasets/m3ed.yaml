Name:  Multi-robot, Multi-Sensor, Multi-Environment Event Dataset (M3ED)
Description: M3ED is the first multi-sensor event camera (EC) dataset focused on high-speed dynamic motions in robotics applications. M3ED provides high-quality synchronized data from multiple platforms (car, legged robot, UAV), operating in challenging conditions such as off-road trails, dense forests, and performing aggressive flight maneuvers. M3ED also covers demanding operational scenarios for EC, such as high egomotion and multiple independently moving objects. M3ED includes high-resolution stereo EC (1280Ã—720), grayscale and RGB cameras, a high-quality IMU, a 64-beam LiDAR, and RTK localization.

UpdateFrequency: The dataset will be uploaded sporadically, when bugs are found and new features are implemented (see [updates](https://m3ed.io/#updates)).
