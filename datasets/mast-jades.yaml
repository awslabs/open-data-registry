Name: The JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey JADES
Description: |
  JADES is an infrared imaging and multi-object spectroscopy survey focused on two deep fields: the Hubble Deep Field (GOODS-N) 
  and Hubble Ultra Deep Field (GOODS-S). JADES conducted NIRCam imaging in 8-10 bands, covering about 42 square arcminutes to very 
  deep limits (fainter than 30th magnitude) with an average of about 100 hours of total exposure time, and then another 167 square arcminutes
  to a typical exposure time of 25 hrs. Coordinated parallels with the MIRI instrument extend this imaging further into the infrared in smaller regions.
  JADES then performed extensive NIRSpec spectroscopy with over 5000 targets on 31 separate pointings, including two deep exposures of
  55 hrs spread across 5 dispersers. The JADES team added additional imaging and spectroscopy in Cycles 1, 2, and 3 from a number of 
  affiliated guest observer programs.
