Description: "The Turquoise Coast (TURQ) HF ocean radar system covers the area of\
  \ shelf between Seabird and Jurien Bay and is the logical continuation of major\
  \ research efforts to understand the role of the Leeuwin Current System (Leeuwin\
  \ Current, the Leeuwin Undercurrent and Capes Current) in controlling not only the\
  \ physical system but also its links to both pelagic and benthic ecosystems.  In\
  \ contrast to eastern ocean basins, which are highly productive, Western Australia\
  \ experiences an oligotrophic environment. The Leeuwin Current is a shallow (<300\
  \ m deep), narrow band (< 100 km wide) of warm, lower salinity, nutrient depleted\
  \ water of tropical origin that flows poleward from Exmouth to Cape Leeuwin and\
  \ into the Great Australian Bight.  The Current plays a dominant role in controlling\
  \ the marine life and climate of the region.  \n\nQuestions which may be addressed\
  \ by using the HF ocean radar data from TURQ (and ROT) include the variability of\
  \ the Leeuwin current and its response to the ENSO cycle;  Leeuwin Current eddies\
  \ and their interaction with the shelf waters; and the interaction between the Leeuwin\
  \ Current, the Capes Current and coastal current during the summer.  This is an\
  \ important region for Western Rock lobster recruitment, and the meanders of the\
  \ warm Leeuwin Current influence the ecology.  This is a region with low tidal range\
  \ and with a coastline subject to strong sea breezes and intense winter storms.\
  \  Coastally trapped waves may be generated by the winter weather systems and by\
  \ tropical cyclones in the summer.  \n\nThe TURQ HF ocean radar system consists\
  \ of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding stations located at Seabird (31.281\
  \ S 115.444 E) and Cervantes (30.506 S  115.060E). From 2012-12-15T11:00:00 the\
  \ Cervantes station has been replaced by the Green Head station (30.073 S 114.967E)\
  \ and from 2013-03-19T00:00:00 the Seabird station has been replaced by the Lancelin\
  \ station (31.027 S 115.328 E). These radars operate at a frequency of 5.211 MHz,\
  \ with a bandwidth of 50 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km\nand a range resolution\
  \ of 3 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\n\n\
  The TURQ area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the\
  \ Rottnest Shelf (ROT) WERA HF ocean radar system on its south side.  Together,\
  \ the TURQ and ROT systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle\
  \ to Jurien Bay."
