Name: OpenFold3 Training Data
Description: This dataset contains MSAs and predicted structures for 13 million long (sequence length >= 200 amino acids) monomers from the MGNIFY database. These MSAs were generated using the AF3 protocol, and were used to predict structures with AlphaFold2. This data serves as the long monomer distillation set for Openfold3, an open-source, all-atom ligand, RNA and protein structure prediction software.
