Name: Humor patterns used for querying Alexa traffic
Description: Humor patterns used for quering Alexa traffic when creating the taxonomy described in the paper "“Alexa, Do You Want to Build a Snowman?” Characterizing Playful Requests to Conversational Agents"  by C. Shani, A. Libov, S. Tolmach, L. Lewin-Eytan, Y. Maarek, and D. Shahaf (CHI LBW 2022). These patterns corrospond to the researchers' hypotheses regarding what humor types are likely to appear in Alexa traffic. These patterns were used for querying Alexa traffic to evaluate these hypotheses.
