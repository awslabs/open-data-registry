Description: "Humor patterns used for querying Alexa traffic when creating the taxonomy\
  \ described in the paper \"\u201CAlexa, Do You Want to Build a Snowman?\u201D Characterizing\
  \ Playful Requests to Conversational Agents\"  by Shani C., Libov A., Tolmach S.,\
  \ Lewin-Eytan L., Maarek Y., and Shahaf D. (CHI LBW 2022). These patterns corrospond\
  \ to the researchers' hypotheses regarding what humor types are likely to appear\
  \ in Alexa traffic. These patterns were used for querying Alexa traffic to evaluate\
  \ these hypotheses."
