Name: SatPM2.5
Description: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations are estimated using information from satellite-, simulation- and monitor-based sources. Aerosol optical depth from multiple satellites (MODIS, VIIRS, MISR, SeaWiFS, and VIIRS) and their respective retrievals (Dark Target, Deep Blue, MAIAC) is combined with simulation (GEOS-Chem) based upon their relative uncertainties as determined using ground-based sun photometer (AERONET) observations to produce geophysical estimates that explain most of the variance in ground-based PM2.5 measurements. A subsequent statistical fusion incorporates additional information from ground-based PM2.5 measurements.
