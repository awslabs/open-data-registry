Description: The Low Altitude Disaster Imagery (LADI) Dataset consists of human and
  machine annotated airborne images collected by the Civil Air Patrol in support of
  various disaster responses from 2015-2019. The initial release of LADI focuses on
  the Atlantic hurricane seasons and coastal states along the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf
  of Mexico. Annotations are included for major hurricanes of Harvey, Maria, and Florence.
  Two key distinctions are the low altitude, oblique perspective of the imagery and
  disaster-related features, which are rarely featured in computer vision benchmarks
  and datasets.
