Name: Spitzer Enhanced Imaging Products (SEIP) Super Mosaics
Description: Spitzer was an infrared astronomy space telescope with imaging from 3 to 160 microns and spectroscopy from 5 to 37 microns, launched into an Earth-trailing solar orbit as the last of NASA's Great Observatories. The SEIP Super Mosaics include data from the four channels of IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8 microns) and the 24 micron channel of MIPS. Data from multiple programs are combined where appropriate. Cryogenic Release v3.0 includes Spitzer data taken during commissioning and cryogenic operations, including calibration data.
