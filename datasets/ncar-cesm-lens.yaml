Description: "The Community Earth System Model (CESM) Large Ensemble Numerical Simulation\
  \ (LENS) dataset includes a 40-member ensemble of climate simulations for the period\
  \ 1920-2100 using historical data (1920-2005) or assuming the RCP8.5 greenhouse\
  \ gas concentration scenario (2006-2100), as well as longer control runs based on\
  \ pre-industrial conditions. The data comprise both surface (2D) and volumetric\
  \ (3D) variables in the atmosphere, ocean, land, and ice domains. The total data\
  \ volume of the original dataset is ~500TB, which has traditionally been stored\
  \ as ~150,000 individual CF/NetCDF files on disk or magnetic tape made available\
  \ through the NCAR Climate Data Gateway for download or via web services.\n\n  \
  \ NCAR has copied a subset (currently ~70 TB) of CESM LENS data to Amazon S3 as\
  \ part of the AWS Public Datasets Program. To optimize for large-scale analytics\
  \ we have represented the data as ~275 Zarr stores format accessible through the\
  \ Python Xarray library. Each Zarr store contains a single physical variable for\
  \ a given model run type and temporal frequency (monthly, daily, 6-hourly).\n"

UpdateFrequency: Rare. The LENS experiment is complete, but we may occasionally copy
  additional fields from NCAR to AWS, or fix problems discovered in the AWS copy.
