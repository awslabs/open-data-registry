Name: MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5-Min L1B Swath 500m
Description: "The MODIS/Terra Calibrated Radiances 5Min L1B Swath 500m data set contains
  calibrated and geolocated at-aperture radiances for 7 discrete bands located in
  the 0.45 to 2.20 micron region of the electromagnetic spectrum. These data are generated
  from the MODIS Level 1A scans of raw radiance and in the process converted to geophysical
  units of W/(m^2 um sr). Additional data are provided including quality flags, error
  estimates and calibration data.\r\n\r\nVisible, shortwave infrared, and near infrared
  measurements are only made during the daytime (except band 26), while radiances
  for the thermal infrared region (bands 20-25, 27-36) are measured continuously.\r\n\r\nChannels
  1 and 2 have 250 m resolution, channels 3 through 7 have 500 m resolution. However,
  for the MODIS L1B 500 m product, the 250 m band radiance data and their associated
  uncertainties have been aggregated to 500m resolution. Thus the entire channel data
  set has been co-registered to the same spatial scale in the 500 m product. Separate
  L1B products are available for the 250 m resolution channels (MOD02QKM) and 1 km
  resolution channels (MOD021KM). For the latter product, the 250 m and 500 m channel
  data (bands 1 through 7) have been aggregated into equivalent 1 km pixel values.\r\n
  \           \r\nSpatial resolution for pixels at nadir is 500 km, degrading to 2.4
  km in the along-scan direction at the scan extremes. However, thanks to the overlapping
  of consecutive swaths and respectively pixels there, the resulting resolution at
  the scan extremes is about 1 km. A 55 degree scanning pattern at the EOS orbit of
  705 km results in a 2330 km orbital swath width and provides global coverage every
  one to two days. A single MODIS Level 1B 500 m granule will contain a scene built
  from 203 scans sampled 2708 times in the cross-track direction, corresponding to
  approximately 5 minutes worth of data; thus 288 granules will be produced per day.
  Since an individual MODIS scan will contain 20 along-track spatial elements for
  the 500 m channels, the scene will be composed of (2708 x 4060) pixels, resulting
  in a spatial coverage of (2330 km x 2040 km). Due to the MODIS scan geometry, there
  will be increasing scan overlap beyond about 20 degrees scan angle.      \r\n\r\nTo
  summarize, the MODIS L1B 500 m data product consists of:\r\n            \r\n1. Calibrated
  radiances, uncertainties and number of samples for (2) 250 m reflected solar bands
  aggregated to 500 m resolution\r\n            \r\n2. Calibrated radiances and uncertainties
  for (5) 500 m reflected solar bands\r\n            \r\n3. Geolocation for 1km pixels,
  that must be interpolated to get 500 m pixel locations. For the relationship of
  1km pixels to 500m pixels, see the Geolocation ATBD https://modis.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/atbd/atbd_mod28_v3.pdf.\r\n
  \           \r\n4. Calibration data for all channels (scale and offset) \r\n            \r\n5.
  Comprehensive set of file-level metadata summarizing the spatial, temporal and parameter
  attributes of the data, as well as auxiliary information pertaining to instrument
  status and data quality characterization users requiring all geolocation and solar/satellite
  geometry fields at 1km resolution can obtain the separate MODIS Level 1 Geolocation
  product (MOD03) from LAADS  https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/ . \r\n            \r\nThe
  shortname for this product is MOD02HKM and is stored in the Earth Observing System
  Hierarchical Data Format (HDF-EOS). A typical MOD02HKM file size is approximately
  135 MB.\r\n            \r\nEnvironmental information derived from MODIS L1B measurements
  will offer a comprehensive and unprecedented look at terrestrial, atmospheric, and
  ocean phenomenology for a wide and diverse community of users throughout the world.\r\n\r\nSee
