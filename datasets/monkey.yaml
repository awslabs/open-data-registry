Name: MONKEY
Description: This dataset contains the training data for the [Machine learning for Optimal detection of iNflammatory cells in the KidnEY or MONKEY](https://monkey.grand-challenge.org/) challenge. The MONKEY challenge focuses on the automated detection and classification of inflammatory cells, specifically monocytes and lymphocytes, in kidney transplant biopsies using Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stained whole-slide images (WSI). It contains 80 WSI, collected from 4 different pathology institutes, with annotated regions of interest. For each WSI up to 3 different PAS scans and one IHC slide scan are available. This dataset and challenge support the development of AI models that can aid in the diagnostic process, reduce pathologistsâ€™ workload, and improve patient outcomes in renal transplantation.
