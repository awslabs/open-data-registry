Name: A region-wide, multi-year set of crop field boundary labels for Africa
Description: >
  Crop field boundaries digitized in Planet imagery collected across Africa
  between 2017 and 2023, developed by [Farmerline](https://farmerline.co/), [Spatial Collective](https://spatialcollective.com/), 
  and the [Agricultural Impacts Research Group](https://agroimpacts.info/) at [Clark University](https://www.clarku.edu/), with support from the
  [Lacuna Fund](https://lacunafund.org/) ([Estes et al, 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18483); [Wussah et al. (2023)](https://zenodo.org/records/11060871)). This dataset has been 
  further supplemented by additional labels collected primarily for 
  for 2018 over a subset of countries, which provide an example of their
  application in training and validating a CNN-based cropland mapping model 
  [(Khallaghi et al. 2025)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/17/3/474).
Documentation: Information on the primary dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/agroimpacts/lacunalabels/).
  Documentation for added labels is available [here](https://github.com/agroimpacts/cnn-generalization-enhancement).
