Description: The up-to-date weather radar from the FMI radar network is available
  as Open Data. The data contain both single radar data along with composites over
  Finland in GeoTIFF and HDF5-formats. Available composite parameters consist of radar
  reflectivity (DBZ), rainfall intensity (RR), and precipitation accumulation of 1,
  12, and 24 hours. Single radar parameters consist of radar reflectivity (DBZ), radial
  velocity (VRAD), rain classification (HCLASS), and Cloud top height (ETOP 20). Raw
  volume data from singe radars are also provided in HDF5 format with ODIM 2.3 conventions.
  Radar data becomes available as soon as it's received from the radar and pre-processed
  into deliverable formats. Typically the most recent radar data was collected less
  than 5 minutes ago.
