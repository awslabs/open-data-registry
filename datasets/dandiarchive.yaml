Name: Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI)
Description: |
  DANDI is a public archive of neurophysiology datasets, including raw and processed data,
  and associated software containers. Datasets are shared according to Creative Commons
  CC0 or CC-BY licenses. This US BRAIN Initiative supported archive provides a broad range
  of cellular neurophysiology data including intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology,
  optophysiology, calcium imaging, fiber photometry, behavioral time-series, and images from
  immunostaining experiments, from over 20 species.

  Data is organized using community standards:
  [NWB - Neurodata Without Borders](https://www.nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/),
  [BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/),
  [NGFF - Next Generation File Format](https://ngff.openmicroscopy.org/) for Zarr-based imaging data, and
  [NIDM - Neuro Imaging Data Model](http://nidm.nidash.org/).

  The S3 bucket is organized as follows:
  - **dandisets/** - Metadata and manifests for each Dandiset version; manifests reference keys
    under blobs/ or zarrs/ for actual data. See [DANDI schema](https://github.com/dandi/schema/)
    for manifest format specifications.
  - **blobs/** - Deduplicated binary data (NWB files) indexed by content hash.
  - **zarrs/** - Zarr arrays for large imaging datasets.

  Development of DANDI is supported by the National Institute of Mental Health.
