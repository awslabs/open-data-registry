Name: Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI)
Description: >
  DANDI is a public archive of neurophysiology datasets, including raw and processed data, 
  and associated software containers. Datasets are shared according to a Creative Commons 
  CC0 or CC-BY licenses. The data archive provides a broad range of cellular neurophysiology data. 
  This includes electrode and optical recordings, and associated imaging data using a 
  set of community standards: [NWB:N - NWB:Neurophysiology](https://www.nwb.org/nwb-neurophysiology/),
  [BIDS - Brain Imaging Data Structure](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/), and 
  [NIDM - Neuro Imaging Data Model](http://nidm.nidash.org/). Development of DANDI is 
  supported by the National Institute of Mental Health.
