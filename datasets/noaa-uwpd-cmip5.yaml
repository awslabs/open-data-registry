Description: "The University of Wisconsin Probabilistic Downscaling (UWPD) is a statistically\
  \ downscaled dataset based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5\
  \ (CMIP5) climate models. UWPD consists of three variables, daily precipitation\
  \ and maximum and minimum temperature. The spatial resolution is 0.1<span>&#176;</span>x0.1<span>&#176;</span>\
  \ degree resolution for the United States and southern Canada east of the Rocky\
  \ Mountains.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downscaling methodology is not deterministic. Instead,\
  \ to properly capture unexplained variability and extreme events, the methodology\
  \ predicts a spatially and temporally varying Probability Density Function (PDF)\
  \ for each variable. Statistics such as the mean, mean PDF and annual maximum statistics\
  \ can be calculated directly from the daily PDF and these statistics are included\
  \ in the dataset. In addition, \u201Cstandard\u201D, \u201Craw\u201D data is created\
  \ by randomly sampling from the PDFs to create a \u201Crealization\u201D of the\
  \ local scale given the large-scale from the climate model. There are 3 realizations\
  \ for temperature and 14 realizations for precipitation.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe directory\
  \ structure of the data is as follows\n<br/>\n<code>[cmip_version]/[scenario]/[climate_model]/[ensemble_member]/</code>\n\
  <br/>\nThe realizations are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_[realization_number]_[year].nc</code>\n\
  <code>temp_[realization_number]_[year].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe time mean files averaged\
  \ over certain year bounds are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_mean_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n\
  <code>temp_mean_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe time-mean Cumulative\
  \ Distribution Function (CDF) files are as follows\n<br/>\n<code>prcp_cdf_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n\
  <code>temp_cdf_[year_bound_1]_[year_bound_2].nc</code>\n<br/>\nThe CDF of the annual\
  \ maximum precipitation is given for each year in the record\n<code>prcp_annual_max_cdf_[start_year_of_scenario]_[end_year_of_scenario].nc</code>\n\
