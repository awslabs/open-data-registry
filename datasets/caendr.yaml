Name: Caenorabditis Diversity Natural Resource 
Description: The Caenorhabditis Natural Diversity Resource (CaeNDR) is a data repository and analysis hub of wild strains of selfing Caenhorabditis species C. elegans, C. briggsae, and C. tropicalis from around the world to facilitate discovery of genetic variation across all three species through genome-wide association mappings to correlate genotype with phenotype and identify genetic variation underlying quantitative traits.
