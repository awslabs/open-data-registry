Name: Ships of Opportunity - Expendable bathythermographs - Delayed mode
Description: IMOS Ship of Opportunity Underway Expendable Bathythermographs (XBT)
  group is a research and data collection project working within the IMOS Ship of
  Opportunity Multi-Disciplinary Underway Network sub-facility. Five major (HRX) high-resolution
  XBT lines provide boundary to boundary profiling and closely spaced sampling to
  resolve mesoscale eddies, fronts and boundary currents. The lines are repeated 4
  times per year by an on-board technician. The routes sample each major boundary
  current system using available commercial vessel traffic. All of the transects transmit
  data in real-time. The data represented by this record are presented in delayed
  mode. This SOOP dataset covers the Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean and Pacific Oceans.
