Description: The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) coordinates projects
  with the common aim of accelerating research into the causes and control of cancer.
  The PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is an international collaboration
  to identify common patterns of mutation in whole genomes from ICGC. More than 2,400
  consistently analyzed genomes corresponding to over 1,100 unique ICGC donors are
  now freely available on Amazon S3 to credentialed researchers subject to ICGC data
  sharing policies.
