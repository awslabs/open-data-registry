Name: ICGC on AWS
Description: The International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) coordinates projects with the common aim of accelerating research into the causes and control of cancer. The PanCancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) study is an international collaboration to identify common patterns of mutation in whole genomes from ICGC. More than 2,400 consistently analyzed genomes corresponding to over 1,100 unique ICGC donors are now freely available on Amazon S3 to credentialed researchers subject to ICGC data sharing policies.
