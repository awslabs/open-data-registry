Name: Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) Species Occurrences
Description: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an international network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments providing global data that document the occurrence of species. GBIF currently integrates datasets documenting over 1.6 billion species occurrences, growing daily. The GBIF occurrence dataset combines data from a wide array of sources including specimen-related data from natural history museums, observations from citizen science networks and environment recording schemes. While these data are constantly changing at GBIF.org, periodic snapshots are taken and made available on AWS.
