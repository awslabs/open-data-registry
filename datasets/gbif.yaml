Description: The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an international
  network and data infrastructure funded by the world's governments providing global
  data that document the occurrence of species. GBIF currently integrates datasets
  documenting over 1.6 billion species occurrences, growing daily. The GBIF occurrence
  dataset combines data from a wide array of sources including specimen-related data
  from natural history museums, observations from citizen science networks and environment
  recording schemes. While these data are constantly changing at GBIF.org, periodic
  snapshots are taken and made available on AWS.
