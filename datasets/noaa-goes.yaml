Name: GOES on AWS
Description: |
  GOES satellites (GOES-16 & GOES-17) provide continuous weather imagery and
  monitoring of meteorological and space environment data across North America.
  GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for
  intensive data analysis. They hover continuously over one position on the surface.
  The satellites orbit high enough to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because
  they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the
  atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods,
  hailstorms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able
  to monitor storm development and track their movements.
