Name: "NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) 16, 17, 18 & 19"
Description: |
  <br/>
  <br/> 
  NEW GOES-19 Data!!! GOES-19 products at the Provisional maturity level have begun streaming. Data files will be available between Provisional and the Operational Declaration of the satellite, however, these data are subject to the caveat that they are "GOES-19 Preliminary, Non-Operational Data".
  <br/>
  <br/> 
  NOTICE: As of January 10th 2023, GOES-18 assumed the GOES-West position and all data files are deemed both operational and provisional, so no ‘preliminary, non-operational’ caveat is needed. GOES-17 is now offline, shifted approximately 105 degree West, where it will be in on-orbit storage. GOES-17 data will no longer flow into the GOES-17 bucket. Operational GOES-West products can be found in the GOES-18 bucket. 
  <br/>
  <br/> 
  GOES satellites (GOES-16, GOES-17, GOES-18 & GOES-19) provide continuous weather imagery and
  monitoring of meteorological and space environment data across North America.
  GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary for
  intensive data analysis. They hover continuously over one position on the surface.
  The satellites orbit high enough to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because
  they stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the
  atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods,
  hailstorms, and hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able
  to monitor storm development and track their movements. SUVI products available in both NetCDF and FITS.
