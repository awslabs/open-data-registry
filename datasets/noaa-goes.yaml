Description: "<br/>\n<br/> \n**DATA FEED ISSUES - Due to major damage to critical\
  \ infrastructure in the Asheville, NC area from Hurricane Helene, our GOES data\
  \ feeds to the cloud have been impacted. We are working with local authorities and\
  \ service providers in hopes that we can restore these feeds ASAP. Note that major\
  \ celluar and network (fiber) infrastructure have been damaged and this may take\
  \ time to adress. Thank you for your continued support.** \n<br/>\n<br/> \nNOTICE:\
  \ As of January 10th 2023, GOES-18 assumed the GOES-West position and all data files\
  \ are deemed both operational and provisional, so no \u2018preliminary, non-operational\u2019\
  \ caveat is needed. GOES-17 is now offline, shifted approximately 105 degree West,\
  \ where it will be in on-orbit storage. GOES-17 data will no longer flow into the\
  \ GOES-17 bucket. Operational GOES-West products can be found in the GOES-18 bucket.\
  \ \n<br/>\n<br/> \nNEW GOES-18 Data!!! GOES-18 is now provisional and data has began\
  \ streaming. Data files will be available between Provisional and the Operational\
  \ Declaration of the satellite, however, data will have the caveat GOES-18 Preliminary,\
  \ Non-Operational Data. The exception is during the interleave period when ABI Radiances\
  \ and Cloud and Moisture Imagery data will be shared operationally via the NOAA\
  \ Open Data Dissemination Program.\n<br/>\n<br/> \nGOES satellites (GOES-16, GOES-17,\
  \ & GOES-18) provide continuous weather imagery and\nmonitoring of meteorological\
  \ and space environment data across North America.\nGOES satellites provide the\
  \ kind of continuous monitoring necessary for\nintensive data analysis. They hover\
  \ continuously over one position on the surface.\nThe satellites orbit high enough\
  \ to allow for a full-disc view of the Earth. Because\nthey stay above a fixed spot\
  \ on the surface, they provide a constant vigil for the\natmospheric \"triggers\"\
  \ for severe weather conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods,\nhailstorms, and\
  \ hurricanes. When these conditions develop, the GOES satellites are able\nto monitor\
  \ storm development and track their movements. SUVI products available in both NetCDF\
  \ and FITS. \n"
