Description: The UCSC Genome Browser is an online graphical viewer for genomes, a
  genome browser, hosted by the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). The interactive
  website offers access to genome sequence data from a variety of vertebrate and invertebrate
  species and major model organisms, integrated with a large collection of aligned
  annotations. This dataset is a copy of the MySQL tables in MyISAM binary and tab-sep
  format and all binary files in custom formats, sometimes referred as 'gbdb'-files.
  Data from the UCSC Genome Browser is free and open for use by anyone. However, every
  genome annotation track has been created by an academic research group, or, in a
  few cases, by commercial companies. Please acknowledge them by citing them. The
  information can be found by going to https://genome.ucsc.edu, selecting the respective
  genome assembly and clicking on the data track. At the end of the documentation,
  we provide a list of references and acknowledgements.
