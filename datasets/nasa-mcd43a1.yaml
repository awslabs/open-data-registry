Name: MODIS/Terra+Aqua BRDF/Albedo Model Parameters Daily L3 Global - 500m V061
Description: "The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43A1 Version
  6.1 Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and Albedo (BRDF/Albedo) Model
  Parameters dataset is produced daily using 16 days of Terra and Aqua MODIS data
  at 500 meter (m) resolution. Data are temporally weighted to the ninth day of the
  retrieval period which is reflected in the Julian date in the file name. MCD43A1
  provides the three model weighting parameters (isotropic, volumetric, and geometric)
  used to derive the Albedo ([MCD43A3](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A3.061))
  and Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) ([MCD43A4](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A4.061))
  products.\n\nUsers are urged to use the band specific quality flags to isolate the
  highest quality full inversion results for their own science applications as described
  in the [User Guide](https://www.umb.edu/spectralmass/modis-user-guide-v006-and-v0061/mcd43a1-brdfalbedo-model-parameters-product/).\n\nThe
  MCD43A1 provides the three model weighting parameters for MODIS spectral bands 1
  through 7 as well as the visible, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave bands. Along
  with the three-dimensional parameter layers for these bands are the simplified mandatory
  quality layers for each of the 10 bands. Essential quality information provided
  in the corresponding [MCD43A2](https://doi.org/10.5067/MODIS/MCD43A2.061) data file
  should be consulted when using this product. \n\nKnown Issues\n\n* For complete
  information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment
  website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=TerraAqua&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
