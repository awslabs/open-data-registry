Name: USGS COAWST (Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave and Sediment Transport) Forecast Model Archive, US East and Gulf Coasts
Description: The COAWST modeling system has been used to simulate ocean, wave and sediment transport processes along the of US East Coast and Gulf of Mexico. The grid has a horizontal resolution of approximately 5km and is resolved with 16 vertical terrain following levels. The model has been executed on a daily basis since August 2009 with outputs written every hour. This archive contains model output from 2009-09-21 to 2022-06-17.
