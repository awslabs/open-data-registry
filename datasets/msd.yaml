Description: 'With recent advances in machine learning, semantic segmentation algorithms
  are becoming increasingly general purpose and translatable to unseen tasks. Many
  key algorithmic advances in the field of medical imaging are commonly validated
  on a small number of tasks, limiting our understanding of the generalisability of
  the proposed contributions. A model which works out-of-the-box on many tasks, in
  the spirit of AutoML, would have a tremendous impact on healthcare. The field of
  medical imaging is also missing a fully open source and comprehensive benchmark
  for general purpose algorithmic validation and testing covering a large span of
  challenges, such as: small data, unbalanced labels, large-ranging object scales,
  multi-class labels, and multimodal imaging, etc. This challenge and dataset aims
  to provide such resource through the open sourcing of large medical imaging datasets
  on several highly different tasks, and by standardising the analysis and validation
  process.'
