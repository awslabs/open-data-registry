Name: "A2D2: AEV Autonomous Driving Dataset"
Description:
        An open multi-sensor dataset for autonomous driving research.
        This dataset comprises semantically segmented images, semantic
        point clouds, and 3D bounding boxes. In addition, it contains
        unlabelled 360 degree camera images, lidar, and bus data for
        three sequences. We hope this dataset will further facilitate
        active research and development in AI, computer vision, and
        robotics for autonomous driving.
