    Title: Autonomous Driving Data Service (ADDS)
    URL: https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-eks-autonomous-driving-data-service
Description: An open multi-sensor dataset for autonomous driving research. This dataset
  comprises semantically segmented images, semantic point clouds, and 3D bounding
  boxes. In addition, it contains unlabelled 360 degree camera images, lidar, and
  bus data for three sequences. We hope this dataset will further facilitate active
  research and development in AI, computer vision, and robotics for autonomous driving.
