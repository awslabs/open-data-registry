Name: GEOGloWS Hydrologic Model Version 2
Description: |
  The GEOGloWS Hydrologic Model provides a global simulation of river discharge. The model simulates river discharge at 
  7 million river segments over a period of more than 80 years beginning on 1 January 1940. The retrospective simulation 
  is updated weekly to monthly keeping the lag time small. The model is also used to produce daily forecasts which are 
  not archived in this repository. The model is based on the ERA5 reanalysis climate data and forecasts are derived from 
  the ECMWF Integrated Forecast System (IFS). The stream network is derived from the TDX-Hydro streams and basins data 
  produced by the United State's National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The model simulations are computed daily at 
  the ECMWF super computing facility in Bologna, Italy.<br><br>
  This repository contains: (1) model configuration files used to generate the simulations, (2) the model retrospective 
  outputs in zarr format optimized for time series queries of up to a few hundred rivers on demand, (3) the model output 
  in netCDF format best for bulk downloading large volumes of data, (4) estimated return period flows for all 7 million 
  rivers in netCDF format, (5) the GIS streams datasets used by the model, (6) the GIS streams datasets optimized for 
  visualizations used by Esri's Living Atlas layer.
