Name: NEXRAD ARCO - Analysis-Ready Cloud-Optimized Weather Radar
Description: NEXRAD Level II weather radar data converted to FAIR-compliant, analysis-ready cloud-optimized (ARCO) format using Zarr v3 and Icechunk. Hierarchically organized by Volume Coverage Pattern (VCP) and sweep, enabling instant time-series access to polarimetric variables (DBZH, ZDR, RHOHV, PHIDP, VELOCITY) without downloading individual files. Currently includes KLOT (Chicago, IL) with continuous updates.
