Name:  RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection
Description: "RSNA assembled this dataset in 2019 for the RSNA Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection AI Challenge (https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-intracranial-hemorrhage-detection/). De-identified head CT studies were provided by four research institutions. A group of over 60 volunteer expert radiologists recruited by RSNA and the American Society of Neuroradiology labeled over 25,000 exams for the presence and subtype classification of acute intracranial hemorrhage."
