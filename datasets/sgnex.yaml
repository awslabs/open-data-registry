Name: The Singapore Nanopore Expression Data Set
Description: The SG-NEx project is an international collaboration that was initiated at the Genome Institute of Singapore. The aim of the SG-NEx Project is to generate reference transcriptomes for the most commonly used cancer cell lines using Nanopore long read RNA-Seq data.
Transcriptome profiling is done using PCR-cDNA sequencing ("PCR-cDNA"), amplification-free cDNA sequencing ("direct cDNA"), direct sequencing of native RNA (“direct RNA”), and short read RNA-Seq. All samples are sequenced with at least 3 high quality replicates. For a subset of samples, we used sequin spike-in RNAs.
