Name: End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock
Description: |
  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded a three-year project, End-Use Load Profiles for the U.S. Building Stock, that culminated in this publicly
  available dataset of calibrated and validated 15-minute resolution load profiles for all major residential and commercial building types and end uses,
  across all climate regions in the United States. These EULPs were created by calibrating the ResStock and ComStock physics-based building stock models
  using many different measured datasets, as described [here](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy22osti/80889.pdf).
  This dataset includes load profiles for both the baseline building stock and the building stock with various energy efficiency, electrification,
  and demand flexibility upgrades applied.
