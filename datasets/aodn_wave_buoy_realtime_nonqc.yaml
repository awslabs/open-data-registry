Name: Wave buoys observations - Real time
Description: "Buoys provide integral wave parameters. Buoy data from the following\
  \ organisations contribute to the National Wave Archive: Manly Hydraulics Laboratory\
  \ (part of the NSW Department of Planning and Environment (DPE), which has assumed\
  \ function of the former NSW Office of Environment and Heritage (OEH)); Bureau of\
  \ Meteorology; Western Australia Department of Transport (DOT); the Queensland Department\
  \ of Environment and Science (DES); the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS);\
  \ Gippsland Ports; the NSW Nearshore Wave Data Program from the NSW Department of\
  \ Planning and Environment (DPE); the University of Western Australia (UWA); Deakin\
  \ University, Pilbara Ports Authority and Flinders University and South Australian\
  \ Research and Development Institute (SARDI). \n\nThe data from MHL, BOM, DOT, DES,\
  \ Gippsland Ports and Pilbara Ports Authority, is gathered by the Waverider system\
  \ developed by the Dutch company, Datawell. Some older wave data were collected\
  \ using non-directional Waverider buoys. As technology advanced and directional\
  \ measuring capabilities were developed in wave buoys, wave buoy networks were gradually\
  \ upgraded to directional Waverider buoys. Therefore, some older datasets do not\
  \ have directional information whereas newer datasets have directional information.\n\
  \nThe data from IMOS, the NSW Nearshore Wave Data Program, DPE, UWA, Deakin, Flinders\
  \ University and SARDI comes from Spotter Wave Buoys, developed by Sofar Ocean Technologies,\
  \ which collect data similarly to the Waverider system.\n\nBOM, DES, DOT, MHL, IMOS\
  \ (some) and Gippsland Ports - The wave buoy data is issued in GTS bulletins (which\
  \ are only available for 24 hours) : IOWK01 (in BUFR format) and SWWE01 (CREX format).\
  \ The data is collated by the Bureau into a CSV file (containing the last 24 hours\
  \ of observations) which is updated every hour, at 5 minutes past the hour. This\
  \ data is provided via WFS to the AODN.\nNote - The Maria Island buoy is currently\
  \ undergoing repairs, so data is unavailable, we will update when resolved (May\
  \ 2024).\n\nIMOS (some), DPE, UWA, Deakin, Flinders University + SARDI - The data\
  \ is updated every hour, at 40 minutes past the hour.\n\nPilbara Ports Authority\
  \ - The data is uploaded every hour, at 30 minutes past the hour."
