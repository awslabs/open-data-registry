Description: "An International Group for High Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST)\
  \ Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis\
  \ at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using optimal interpolation (OI) on a\
  \ regional 1/12 degree grid over the Australian region (20N - 70S, 60E - 170W).\
  \ This Regional Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (RAMSSA) v1.0 system blends\
  \ infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)\
  \ on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST observations from the\
  \ Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W, and in situ data\
  \ from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications System\
  \ (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected to be\
  \ affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent surface\
  \ wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the night,\
  \ thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free of diurnal\
  \ warming effects."
