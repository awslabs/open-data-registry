Description: "The [Ven\xB5s science mission](https://www.theia-land.fr/en/product/venus/)\
  \ is a joint research mission undertaken by CNES and ISA, \nthe Israel Space Agency.\
  \ It aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of high-resolution multi-temporal observation\
  \ optimised through \nCopernicus, the global environmental and security monitoring\
  \ programme. Ven\xB5s was launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais by a \nVEGA\
  \ rocket, during the night from 2017, August 1st to 2nd. Thanks to its multispectral\
  \ camera (12 spectral bands in the visible \nand near-infrared ranges, with spectral\
  \ characteristics provided [here](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/?page_id=14229)),\
  \ it \nacquires imagery every 1-2 days over 100+ areas at a spatial resolution of\
  \ 4 to 5m. This dataset has been converted into Cloud \nOptimized GeoTIFFs (COGs).\
  \ Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata are generated in a JSON file\
  \ alongside the data. \nThis dataset contains all of the Venus L2A datasets and\
  \ will continue to grow as the Venus mission acquires new data over the \npreselected\
  \ sites.\n"
