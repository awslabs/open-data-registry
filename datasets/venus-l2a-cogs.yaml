Name: VENUS L2A Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs
Description: |
  The [Venµs science mission](https://www.theia-land.fr/en/product/venus/) is a joint research mission undertaken by CNES and ISA, 
  the Israel Space Agency. It aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of high-resolution multi-temporal observation optimised through 
  Copernicus, the global environmental and security monitoring programme. Venµs was launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais by a 
  VEGA rocket, during the night from 2017, August 1st to 2nd. Thanks to its multispectral camera (12 spectral bands in the visible 
  and near-infrared ranges, with spectral characteristics provided [here](https://labo.obs-mip.fr/multitemp/?page_id=14229)), it 
  acquires imagery every 1-2 days over 100+ areas at a spatial resolution of 4 to 5m. This dataset has been converted into Cloud 
  Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs). Additionally, SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog metadata are generated in a JSON file alongside the data. 
  This dataset contains all of the Venus L2A datasets and will continue to grow as the Venus mission acquires new data over the 
  preselected sites.
