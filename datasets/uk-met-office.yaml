Name: UK Met Office Atmospheric Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasts
Description: |
  Meteorological data reusers now have an exciting opportunity to sample, experiment and evaluate
  Met Office atmospheric model data, whilst also experiencing a transformative method of requesting
  data via Restful APIs on AWS. All ahead of Met Officeâ€™s own operationally supported API platform
  that will be launched in late 2019.
  
  For information about the data see the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data-provision/big-data-drive/wholesale/categories/planetary-scale-applications).
  For examples of using the data check out the [examples repository](https://github.com/MetOffice/aws-earth-examples). 
  If you need help and support using the data please raise an issue on the examples repository.
