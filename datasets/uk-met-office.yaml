Name: UK Met Office Atmospheric Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasts
Description: |
  Meteorological data reusers now have an exciting opportunity to sample, experiment and evaluate
  Met Office atmospheric model data, whilst also experiencing a transformative method of requesting
  data via Restful APIs on AWS. 

  For information about the data see the [Met Office website](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/met-office-data-for-reuse/discovery).
  For examples of using the data check out the [examples repository](https://github.com/MetOffice/aws-earth-examples).
  If you need help and support using the data please raise an issue on the examples repository.
 
   **Please note:** Met Office continuously improves and updates its operational forecast models. 
  Our last update became effective 04/12/2019. Please find the details [here](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/services/data/met-office-data-for-reuse/ps43_aws).
