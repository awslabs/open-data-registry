Description: 'Grillo has developed an IoT-based earthquake early-warning system,

  with sensors currently deployed in Mexico, Chile, Puerto Rico and Costa Rica,

  and is now opening its entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer

  data to the world to encourage the development of new algorithms

  capable of rapidly detecting and characterizing earthquakes in

  real time.
