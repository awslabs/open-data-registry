Description: |
    Grillo has developed an IoT-based earthquake early-warning system in Mexico and Chile
    and is now opening its entire archive of unprocessed accelerometer data to the world
    to encourage the development of new algorithms capable of rapidly detecting
    and characterizing earthquakes in real time.
