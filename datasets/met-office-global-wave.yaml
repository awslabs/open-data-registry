Name: Met Office Global Wave model on a 2-year rolling archive
Description: The Met Office runs global wave forecast models to support marine safety and operational decision making. Met
  Office configurations are developed to be run using the community wave model WAVEWATCH IIITM. The global
  wave configuration is designed to generate accurate forecasts for open waters of the world’s oceans and larger
  seas. The Met Office wave models are forced using wind data from the Met Office Global Atmospheric Hi-Res
  Model. The global wave model is run to provide a five day outlook for wave characteristics defining height, period and
  direction of waves within a given sea-state. The model uses a refined grid system in order to better represent fetch
  in constrained sea areas and blocking effects of islands and headlands.
  Please note this is a public beta and therefore a non-operational service.
