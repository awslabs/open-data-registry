Name: NOAA Severe Weather Data Inventory (SWDI)
Description: |
  The Storm Events Database is an integrated database of severe weather events across the United States from 1950 to this year, with information about a storm event's location, azimuth, distance, impact, and severity, including the cost of damages to property and crops. It contains data documenting: The occurrence of storms and other significant weather phenomena having sufficient intensity to cause loss of life, injuries, significant property damage, and/or disruption to commerce. Rare, unusual, weather phenomena that generate media attention, such as snow flurries in South Florida or the San Diego coastal area. Other significant meteorological events, such as record maximum or minimum temperatures or precipitation that occur in connection with another event. Data about a specific event is added to the dataset within 120 days to allow time for damage assessments and other analysis.
