Name: CitrusFarm Dataset
Description: |
  CitrusFarm is a multimodal agricultural robotics dataset that provides both multispectral images and navigational sensor data for localization, mapping and crop monitoring tasks. 
  1) It was collected by a wheeled mobile robot in the Agricultural Experimental Station at the University of California Riverside in the summer of 2023. 
  2) It offers a total of nine sensing modalities, including stereo RGB, depth, monochrome, near-infrared and thermal images, as well as wheel odometry, LiDAR, IMU and GPS-RTK data. 
  3) It comprises seven sequences collected from three citrus tree fields, featuring various tree species at different growth stages, distinctive planting patterns, as well as varying daylight conditions. 
  4) It spans a total operation time of 1.7 hours, covers a total distance of 7.5 km, and constitutes 1.3 TB of data.
