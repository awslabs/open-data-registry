Name: Telomere-to-Telomere Korean Pangenome Project
Description: >
  A 1.55 PB open-access collection of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) Korean genomes,
  including long-read sequencing (Oxford Nanopore ultra-long, PacBio HiFi),
  chromosomal conformation capture data, phased diploid assemblies, pangenome
  graph representations, and variant datasets. This resource enables accurate
  construction of the first comprehensive Korean pangenome reference and
  supports population genetics, graph-based alignment, structural variant
  discovery, and precision medicine research for East Asian populations.
