Name: Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) Year 2 Epigenomes
Description: |
    The Human Pangenome Reference Consortium (HPRC) Release 2 represents a landmark achievement in genomics, providing high-quality phased genome assemblies from over 200 individuals with comprehensive functional genomics data. The HPRC Epigenome Navigator provides researchers a way to explore all data generated by release 2, however, efficiently exploring, selecting and accessing processed epigenomics datasets for direct visualizations remains challenging. Here, we present the HPRC Epigenome Navigator (HPRCEN), a modern, interactive web portal that democratizes access to HPRC Release 2 epigenomics data through an intuitive interface supporting genome selection, data visualization, and bulk download capabilities. The portal integrates genome assemblies, DNA methylation profiles, gene expression data, and chromatin accessibility measurements across diverse populations, enabling researchers to efficiently identify and retrieve datasets matching their specific research needs. Built with modern web technologies and designed for scalability, HPRCEN serves as a critical bridge between the HPRC's comprehensive data resources and the global research community, facilitating the widespread adoption of pangenome-based approaches in human genetics research.
