Name: RCM CEOS ARD
Description: "The [RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM)](https://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/radarsat/) is Canada's third generation of Earth observation satellites. Launched on June 12, 2019, the three identical satellites work together to bring solutions to key challenges for Canadians. As part of ongoing [Open Government](https://open.canada.ca/en/about-open-government) efforts, NRCan has developed a CEOS analysis ready data (ARD) processing capability for RCM and is processing the Canada-wide, 30M Compact-Polarization standard coverage, every 12 days. Previously, users were stuck ordering, downloading and processing RCM images (level 1) on their own, often with expensive software. This new dataset aims to remove these burdens with a new STAC catalog for discover and direct download from S3."
