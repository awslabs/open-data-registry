    Title: Calibration of LOFAR ELAIS-N1 data in the Amazon cloud
    URL: https://www.lofarcloud.uk
  Tools & Applications: null
  Tutorials: null
Description: These data correspond to the [International LOFAR Telescope](http://www.lofar.org/)
  observations of the sky field ELAIS-N1 (16:10:01 +54:30:36) during the cycle 2 of
  observations. There are 11 runs of about 8 hours each plus the corresponding observation
  of the calibration targets before and after the target field. The data are measurement
  sets ([MS](https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html)) containing the cross-correlated
  data and metadata divided in 371 frequency sub-bands per target centred at ~150
  MHz.

  \ is the Low Frequency Array designed and constructed by ASTRON. It has observing,\
  \ data processing, and data storage facilities in several countries, that are owned\
  \ by various parties (each with their own funding sources), and that are collectively\
  \ operated by the ILT foundation under a joint scientific policy. The ILT resources\
