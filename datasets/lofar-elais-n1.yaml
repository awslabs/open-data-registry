Name: LOFAR ELAIS-N1 cycle 2 observations on AWS
Description: These data correspond to the [International LOFAR Telescope](http://www.lofar.org/) observations of the sky field ELAIS-N1 (16:10:01 +54:30:36) during the cycle 2 of observations. There are 11 runs of about 8 hours each plus the corresponding observation of the calibration targets before and after the target field. The data are measurement sets ([MS](https://casa.nrao.edu/Memos/229.html)) containing the cross-correlated data and metadata divided in 371 frequency sub-bands per target centred at ~150 MHz.
