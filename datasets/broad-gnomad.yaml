Name: Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)
Description: |
  The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) is a resource developed by an international coalition of investigators that aggregates and harmonizes both exome and genome data from a wide range of large-scale human sequencing projects. The summary data provided here are released for the benefit of the wider scientific community without restriction on use.
  The v2 data set (GRCh37) spans 125,748 exome sequences and 15,708 whole-genome sequences from unrelated individuals. The v3 data set (GRCh38) spans 71,702 genomes, selected as in v2.
