Name: NOAA Global Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System 2-D (STOFS-2D-Global)
Description: |
  
  NOTICE - The Coast Survey Development Laboratory (CSDL) in NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey has upgraded the Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System (STOFS, formerly ESTOFS) to Version 2.1. A Service Change Notice (SCN) has been issued and can be found "[HERE](https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf_2023_24/scn23-124_stofs_upgrade_v2.1.4_aaf.pdf)"<br /><br />
  
  NOAA's Global Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System 2-D (STOFS-2D-Global) provides users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance of water level conditions for the entire globe. STOFS-2D-Global has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. STOFS-2D-Global was developed in a collaborative effort between the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO), the University of Notre Dame, the University of North Carolina, and The Water Institute of the Gulf. The model generates forecasts out to 180 hours four times per day; forecast output includes water levels caused by the combined effects of storm surge and tides, by astronomical tides alone, and by sub-tidal water levels (isolated storm surge).  <br /><br />

  The hydrodynamic model employed by STOFS-2D-Global is the ADvanced CIRCulation (ADCIRC) finite element model. The model is forced by GFS winds, mean sea level pressure, and sea ice. The unstructured grid used by STOFS-2D-Global consists of 12,785,004 nodes and 24,875,336 triangular elements. Coastal resolution is at least 1.5 km globally, and up to 80 m for the U.S. West Coast and Alaska, up to 90-120 m for the Pacific Islands including Hawaii, Guam, American Samoa, Marianas, Wake Island, Marshall Islands, and Palau, and up to 120 m for the U.S. East Coast and Puerto Rico. The flood plain extends overland to approximately 10 m elevation above MSL for the U.S. East Coast, and up to 20 m elevation above MSL for the Pacific Islands. STOFS-2D-Global water level forecast guidance is referenced to global MSL (GMSL) for gridded output and local MSL (LMSL) for station output (SHEF files are referenced to MLLW). <br /><br />

  STOFS-2D-Global water level forecast guidance output available here include NetCDF, GRIB2, and SHEF files. Please see README documentation for more details.
