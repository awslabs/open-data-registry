Description: "Since 2007, the Integrated Marine Observing System\u2019s Animal Tracking\
  \ Facility (formerly known as the Australian Animal Tracking And Monitoring System\
  \ (AATAMS)) has established a permanent array of acoustic receivers around Australia\
  \ to detect the movements of tagged marine animals in coastal waters. Simultaneously,\
  \ the Animal Tracking Facility developed a centralised national database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au/)\
  \ to encourage collaborative research across the Australian research community and\
  \ provide unprecedented opportunities to monitor broad-scale animal movements. The\
  \ resulting dataset comprises observations of tagged animals in Australian waters\
  \ collected by IMOS infrastructure as well as receivers operated by independent\
  \ research projects and  organisations. This dataset constitutes a valuable resource\
  \ facilitating meta-analysis of animal movement, distributions, and habitat use,\
  \ and is important for relating species distribution shifts with environmental covariates.\n\
  \nThis dataset comprises all available (2007 \u2013 ongoing) quality-controlled\
  \ animal detections collected across the collaborative, continental IMOS network\
  \ for a range of aquatic species (fish, sharks, rays, reptiles, and mammals). Here,\
  \ raw animal detections collated via the IMOS Australian Animal Acoustic Telemetry\
  \ Database have been quality-controlled as per Hoenner et al. (2018). This dataset\
  \ is updated on a six-monthly basis.\n\nNote - There is a static snapshot of the\
  \ database (up until 2017) (http://dx.doi.org/10.4225/69/5979810a7dd6f), and this\
  \ has been documented in a Scientific Data Publication (Hoenner et al. 2018)."
