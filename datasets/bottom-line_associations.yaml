Name: Knowledge Portal Network Bottom-line Genetic Associations
Description: At the Knowledge Portal Network, we aggregate and analyze genetic association results for a wide range of diseases and traits. For any given disease, a large number of individual genetic association datasets may have been generated. To make these results more interpretable, we meta-analyze all datasets for each phenotype, using a method that we term "bottom-line integrative analysis". Here we provide the bottom-line summary statistic files for public download.
