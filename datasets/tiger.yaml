Name: TIGER Training
Description: |
    "This dataset contains the training data for the [Tumor InfiltratinG lymphocytes in breast cancER or TIGER](https://tiger.grand-challenge.org) challenge. TIGER is the first challenge on fully automated assessment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer histopathology slides. TILs are proving to be an important biomarker in cancer patients as they can play a part in killing tumor cells, particularly in some types of breast cancer. Identifying and measuring TILs can help to better target treatments, particularly immunotherapy, and may result in lower levels of other more aggressive treatments, including chemotherapy."
