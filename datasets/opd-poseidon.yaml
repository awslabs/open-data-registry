Name: Poseidon seismic, well, and interpretation data
Description: |
  Raw and interpreted data from Poseidon gas field for use in geoscience machining learning applications.
  - SEISMIC DATA - Cloud-native seismic files in two different formats OpenVDS+ and Real Simple Seismic (rss). Our team converted these from SEG-Y so you can have fast slice access for your machine learning pipeline! Please see our example notebooks on various ways to access the seismic data here and here. Cloud versions (for SageMaker) are here and here. Following seismic datasets are available. We may add more files (seismic attributes/features) during the competition.
    - Near, Mid, and Far Stacks in TWT
    - Full Stack with AGC 
    - Seismic velocity cube (rss only)
  - WELLS - Curated dataset of publicly available wells into a pandas DataFrame and serialized in JSON format. The well names are blanked out. The well data, after deserialization, unfolds into a MultiIndex pandas DataFrame. Well IDs and two-way-time values make up the MultiIndex. Also incoudes inline and crossline positions, true vertical depths (relative to sea level), and elastic logs. There are missing portions of some of the logs. Available well info
    - P/S Velocities, and Density Curves
    - Deviations (accounted for in inline and crosslines)
    - Seismic Calibration (well ties, accounted for in two-way-time index)
  - HORIZONS - Interpreted horizons converted  to a pandas DataFrame and serialized in JSON format by horizon. The Plover formation is the main zone of interest and most well log data is available around this pick. Well logs may not be available or reliable above the Top Jamieson surface. Interpreted horizons for the following surfaces (shallow to deep)
    - Water Bottom
    - Top Heywood
    - Top Johnson
    - Top Jamieson
    - Top Near Plover
