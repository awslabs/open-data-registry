Name: Meta-Organized Stimuli And fMRI Imaging data for Computational modeling (MOSAIC)
Description: This extensible dataset, MOSAIC, aggregates individual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) datasets by leveraging a shared preprocessing pipeline and stimulus curation procedure. This dataset aggregation procedure achieves the scale necessary for neural network training and the diversity needed for generalizable results.
