Description: Live-streamed and archived audio data (~2018-present) from underwater
  microphones (hydrophones) containing marine biological signals as well as ambient
  ocean noise. Hydrophone placement and passive acoustic monitoring effort prioritizes
  detection of orca sounds (calls, clicks, whistles) and potentially harmful noise.
  Geographic focus is on the US/Canada critical habitat of Southern Resident killer
  whales (northern CA to central BC) with initial focus on inland waters of WA. In
  addition to the raw lossy or lossless compressed data, we provide a growing archive
  of annotated bioacoustic bouts.
