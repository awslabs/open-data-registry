Name: Orcasound - bioacoustic data for marine conservation
Description: Live-streamed and archived audio data (~2018-present) from underwater microphones (hydrophones) containing marine biological signals as well as ambient ocean noise. Hydrophone placement and passive acoustic monitoring effort prioritizes detection of orca sounds (calls, clicks, whistles) and potentially harmful noise. Geographic focus is on the US/Canada critical habitat of Southern Resident killer whales (northern CA to central BC) with initial focus on inland waters of WA. In addition to the raw lossy or lossless compressed data, we provide a growing archive of annotated bioacoustic bouts.
