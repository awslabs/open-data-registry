Name: NOAA National Blend of Models (NBM)
Description: >
  The National Blend of Models (NBM) is a nationally consistent and skillful suite of calibrated forecast guidance based on a blend of both NWS and non-NWS numerical weather prediction model data and post-processed model guidance. The goal of the NBM is to create a highly accurate, skillful and consistent starting point for the gridded forecast. The most recent data is under the opnl and expr prefixes. A copy is also placed under the wmo prefix. The wmo prefix is structured like so: wmo/<parameter>/<year>/<month>/<day>/<wmo-file-name> The wmo filename codes can be deciphered using the spreadsheet in the root of the bucket.
