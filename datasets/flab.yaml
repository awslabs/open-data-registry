Name: "FLAb: Fitness Landscapes for Antibodies"
Description: FLAb is the largest publicly available therapeutic antibody dataset designed to train and benchmark protein AI models. It provides open-access, high-quality developability data on diverse therapeutic properties, including expression, thermostability, immunogenicity, aggregation, polyreactivity, binding affinity, and pharmacokinetics.
