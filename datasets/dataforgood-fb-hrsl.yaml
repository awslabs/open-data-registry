Name: High Resolution Population Density Maps + Demographic Estimates by CIESIN and Meta
Description: |
  Population data for a selection of countries, allocated to 1 arcsecond blocks and provided in a combination of CSV
  and Cloud-optimized GeoTIFF files. This refines [CIESIN’s Gridded Population of the World](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4)
  using machine learning models on high-resolution worldwide Maxar
  satellite imagery. CIESIN population counts aggregated from worldwide census
  data are allocated to blocks where imagery appears to contain buildings.
