Name: Marine Animal - Satellite Relay Tagging -  Quality controlled profiles
Description: 'CTD (Conductivity-Temperature_Depth)-Satellite Relay Data Loggers (CTD-SRDLs)
  are used to explore how marine animal behaviour relates to their oceanic environment.
  Loggers developed at the University of St Andrews Sea Mammal Research Unit transmit
  data in near real-time via the Argo satellite system. Data represented here was
  collected in the Southern Ocean, from elephant, fur and Weddell Seals. In 2024 data
  was added from flatback and olive ridley turtles, from a pilot study co-funded by
  the Royal Australian Navy in collaboration with the Australian Institute of Marine
  Science and Indigenous Ranger groups.


  Data parameters measured by the instruments include time, conductivity (salinity),
  temperature, pressure and depth. The data represented by this record have been Qc''d
  and are the Australian subset of the MEOP-CTD database (MEOP: Marine Mammals Exploring
  the Oceans Pole to Pole), complemented with the most recent Southern Ocean deployment
  data. This Australian subset of the Southern Ocean database represents about one
  quarter of the entire MEOP-CTD database, which currently is about 52,000 profiles
  obtained from 275 CTD-SRDL tag deployments. The Australian dataset originated in
  2004, and was initially collected by Mark Hindell''s team based at the University
  of Tasmania, and in later years his data has formed part of the Animal Tracking
  Facility of Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS).'
