Name: "BraiDyn-BC: Cued lever-pull task dataset"
Description: |
  The BraiDyn-BC (Brain Dynamics underlying emergence of Behavioral Change) Database offers an extensive, multimodal dataset that links
  wide-field calcium imaging of the mouse neocortex to comprehensive behavioral measurements during a behavioral task.
  As one of the contents in this database, we newly provide a dataset that includes 15 sessions spanning two weeks of motor skill learning, 
  in which 25 mice were trained to pull a lever to obtain water rewards.
  Simultaneous high-speed videography captures body, facial, and eye movements, and environmental parameters are monitored.
  The dataset also features resting-state cortical activity and sensory-evoked responses, enhancing its utility for both learning-related and
  sensory-driven neural dynamics studies.
  Data are formatted in accordance with the Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) standard, ensuring compatibility with existing analysis tools and
  adherence to the FAIR principles.
  This resource enables in-depth investigations into the neural mechanisms underlying behavior and learning.
  The platform encourages collaborative research, supporting the exploration of rapid within-session learning effects, long-term behavioral adaptations, and neural circuit dynamics.
