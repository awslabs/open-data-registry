Name:  RSNA Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification Dataset (RSNA-LSDD)
Description: "The Radiological Society of North America Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification dataset (RSNA-LSDD) is a collection of over 2,600 magnetic resonance imaging (MR) scans of the lumbar spine annotated by a cohort of about 60 volunteer radiologists recruited by the RSNA, the American Society for Spine Radiology and the American Society of Neuroradiology to identify the location and severity of five degenerative conditions across the five intervertebral disc levels (L1/L2, L2/L3, L3/L4, L4/L5, and L5/S1). The imaging data, comprising over 8,500 image series (Sagittal “T2”, Axial T2 and Sagittal T1), was provided by twelve institutions from across the globe. Initially compiled in 2024 for the RSNA Lumbar Spine Degenerative Classification AI Challenge hosted on Kaggle competition platform (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-2024-lumbar-spine-degenerative-classification), it represents the largest publicly available collection of its kind. Additional information on the dataset and how to make use of it is provided in the Data Resource Publication listed below, as well as on the Kaggle competition website, which also provides access to models developed during the competition."
