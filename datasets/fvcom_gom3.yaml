Name: UMASSD-FVCOM-GOM3-Hindcast
Description: The Finite Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM) was used to simulate ocean water levels, velocity, temperature and salinity over a multi-decadal period (1984-present) in the waters of the Northeast US including the Gulf of Maine.  The model was configured and run by the Dr. Changshen Chen, Director of the Marine Ecosystems Dynamics Modeling Laboratory in the School for Marine Science & Technology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.  The triangular mesh has a varying horizontal resolution from several hundred meters inshore to several kilometers offshore, and 45 terrain-following vertical layers.  The model output was saved at hourly intervals from 2009-08-21 to 2022-06-17.
