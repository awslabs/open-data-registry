Description: "An International Group for High-Resolution Sea Surface Temperature (GHRSST)\
  \ Level 4 sea surface temperature analysis, produced daily on an operational basis\
  \ at the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using optimal interpolation (OI) on a\
  \ global 0.25 degree grid.  This Global Australian Multi-Sensor SST Analysis (GAMSSA)\
  \ v1.0 system blends infra-red SST observations from the Advanced Very High Resolution\
  \ Radiometer (AVHRR) on NOAA and METOP polar-orbiting satellites, microwave SST\
  \ observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR-2) on GCOM-W,\
  \ and in situ data from ships, and drifting and moored buoys from the Global Telecommunications\
  \ System (GTS).  \n\nAll SST observations are filtered for those values suspected\
  \ to be affected by diurnal warming by excluding cases which have experienced recent\
  \ surface wind speeds of below 6 m/s during the day and less than 2 m/s during the\
  \ night, thereby resulting in daily foundation SST estimates that are largely free\
  \ of diurnal warming effects."
