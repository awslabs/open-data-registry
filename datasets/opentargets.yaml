Description: "This a Parquet representation of the Open Targets Platform's [latest\
  \ export](https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). The Open Targets Platform\
  \ integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models\
  \ and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug\
  \ target identification. The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org)\
  \ is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, genomics, and\
  \ chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation.\
  \ \nThis dataset is 'Lakehouse Ready'. Meaning, you can query this data in-place\
  \ straight out of the Registry of Open Data S3 bucket. [Deploy this dataset's corresponding\
  \ CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faws-roda-hcls-datalake.s3.amazonaws.com%2FOpenTargets.latest.RodaTemplate.json&stackName=OpenTargets-Latest-RODA)\
  \ to create the  AWS Glue catalog entries into your account in about 30 seconds.\
  \ That one step will enable you to write SQL with AWS Athena, build dashboards and\
  \ charts with Amazon Quicksight, perform HPC with AWS EMR, or join into your AWS\
  \ Redshift clusters. More detail in (the documentation)[https://github.com/aws-samples/data-lake-as-code/blob/roda/README.md.\n"
