Name: Open Targets - Data Lakehouse Ready
Description: |
  This a Parquet representation of the Open Targets Platform's [latest export](https://www.targetvalidation.org/downloads/data). The Open Targets Platform integrates evidence from genetics, genomics, transcriptomics, drugs, animal models and scientific literature to score and rank target-disease associations for drug target identification. The Open Targets Platform (https://www.targetvalidation.org) is a freely available resource for the integration of genetics, genomics, and chemical data to aid systematic drug target identification and prioritisation. 
  This dataset is 'Lakehouse Ready'. Meaning, you can query this data in-place straight out of the Registry of Open Data S3 bucket. [Deploy this dataset's corresponding CloudFormation template](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/quickcreate?templateUrl=https%3A%2F%2Faws-roda-hcls-datalake.s3.amazonaws.com%2FOpenTargets.latest.RodaTemplate.json&stackName=OpenTargets-Latest-RODA) to create the  AWS Glue catalog entries into your account in about 30 seconds. That one step will enable you to write SQL with AWS Athena, build dashboards and charts with Amazon Quicksight, perform HPC with AWS EMR, or join into your AWS Redshift clusters.
