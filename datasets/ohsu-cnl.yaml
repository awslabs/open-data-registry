Name: OHSU-CNL Open Data
Description: |
  OHSU-CNL study offers the whole exome and RNA-sequencing on a cohort of 100 cases with rare
  hematologic malignancies such as Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), atypical chronic myeloid
  leukemia (aCML), and unclassified myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasms
  (MDS/MPN-U). This dataset contains open RNA-Seq Gene Expression Quantification data.
