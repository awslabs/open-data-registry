Description: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) is a joint effort of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to accelerate our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer. TCGA-funded researchers across the United States have produced a corpus of raw and processed genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic data from thousands of cancer patients.
