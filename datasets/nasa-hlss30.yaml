Name: HLS Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument Surface Reflectance Daily Global 30m
  v2.0
Description: "The Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) project provides consistent
  surface reflectance data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard the joint
  NASA/USGS Landsat 8 satellite and the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Europe’s
  Copernicus Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C satellites. The combined measurement
  enables global observations of the land every 2–3 days at 30-meter (m) spatial resolution.
  The HLS project uses a set of algorithms to obtain seamless products from OLI and
  MSI that include atmospheric correction, cloud and cloud-shadow masking, spatial
  co-registration and common gridding, illumination and view angle normalization,
  and spectral bandpass adjustment. \n\nThe HLSS30 product provides 30-m Nadir Bidirectional
  Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) and is derived
  from Sentinel-2A, Sentinel-2B, and Sentinel-2C MSI data products. The HLSS30 and
  [HLSL30](https://doi.org/10.5067/HLS/HLSL30.002) products are gridded to the same
  resolution and Military Grid Reference System ([MGRS](https://hls.gsfc.nasa.gov/products-description/tiling-system/))
  tiling system and thus are “stackable” for time series analysis.\n\nThe HLSS30 product
  is provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each band is distributed
  as a separate COG. There are 13 bands included in the HLSS30 product along with
  four angle bands and a quality assessment (QA) band. See the User Guide for a more
  detailed description of the individual bands provided in the HLSS30 product.\n\nKnown
  Issues\n\n* Unrealistically high aerosol and low surface reflectance over bright
  areas: The atmospheric correction over bright targets occasionally retrieves unrealistically
  high aerosol and thus makes the surface reflectance too low. High aerosol retrievals,
  both false high aerosol and realistically high aerosol, are masked when quality
  bits 6 and 7 are both set to 1 (see Table 9 in the [User Guide](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/1698/HLS_User_Guide_V2.pdf));
  the corresponding spectral data should be discarded from analysis.\n\n* Issues over
  high latitudes: For scenes greater than or equal to 80 degrees north, multiple overpasses
  can be gridded into a single MGRS tile resulting in an L30 granule with data sensed
  at two different times. In this same area, it is also possible that Landsat overpasses
  that should be gridded into a single MGRS tile are actually written as separate
  data files. Finally, for scenes with a latitude greater than or equal to 65 degrees
  north, ascending Landsat scenes may have a slightly higher error in the BRDF correction
  because the algorithm is calibrated using descending scenes.\n\n* Fmask omission
  errors: There are known issues regarding the Fmask band of this data product that
  impacts HLSL30 data prior to April of 2022. The HLS Fmask data band may have omission
  errors in water detection for cases where water detection using spectral data alone
  is difficult, and omission and commission errors in cloud shadow detection for areas
  with great topographic relief. This issue does not impact other bands in the dataset.\n\n*
  Inconsistent snow surface reflectance between Landsat and Sentinel-2: The HLS snow
  surface reflectance can be highly inconsistent between Landsat and Sentinel-2. When
  assessed on same-day acquisitions from Landsat and Sentinel-2, Landsat reflectance
  is generally higher than Sentinel-2 reflectance in the visible bands.\n\n* Unrealistically
  high snow surface reflectance in the visible bands: By design, the Land Surface
  Reflectance Code (LaSRC) atmospheric correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval
  over snow; instead, a default aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is used to drive the
  snow surface reflectance. If the snow detection fails, the full LaSRC is used in
  both AOT retrieval and surface reflectance derivation over snow, which produces
  surface reflectance values as high as 1.6 in the visible bands. This is a common
  problem for spring images at high latitudes.\n\n* Unrealistically low surface reflectance
  surrounding snow/ice: Related to the above, the AOT retrieval over snow/ice is generally
  too high. When this artificially high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance
  of the neighboring non-snow pixels, very low surface reflectance will result. These
  pixels will appear very dark in the visible bands. If the surface reflectance value
  of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. In Figure 1, the pixels
  in front of the glaciers have surface reflectance values that are too low.  \n\n*
  Unrealistically low reflectance surrounding clouds: Like for snow, the HLS atmospheric
  correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over clouds and a default AOT is used
  instead. But if the cloud detection fails, an artificially high AOT will be retrieved
  over clouds. If the high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance of the neighboring
  cloud-free pixels, very low surface reflectance values will result. If the surface
  reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA value of -9999 is used. \n\n*
  Unusually low reflectance around other bright land targets: While the HLS atmospheric
  correction retrieves AOT over non-cloud, non-snow bright pixels, the retrieved AOT
  over bright targets can be unrealistically high in some cases, similar to cloud
  or snow. If this unrealistically high AOT is used to derive the surface reflectance
  of the neighboring pixels, very low surface reflectance values can result as shown
  in Figure 2. If the surface reflectance value of a pixel is below -0.2, a NO_DATA
  value of -9999 is used. These types of bright targets are mostly man-made, such
  as buildings, parking lots, and roads.  \n\n* Dark plumes over water: The HLS atmospheric
  correction does not attempt aerosol retrieval over water. For water pixels, the
  AOT retrieved from the nearest land pixels is used to derive the surface reflectance,
  but if the retrieval is incorrect, e.g. from a cloud pixel, this high AOT will create
  dark stripes over water, as shown in Figure 3. This happens more often over large
  water bodies, such as lakes and bays, than over narrow rivers.  \n\n* Landsat WRS-2
  Path/Row boundary in L30 reflectance: HLS performs atmospheric correction on Landsat
  Level 1 images in the original Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS2) path/row before
  the derived surface reflectance is reprojected into Military Grid Reference System
  (MGRS) tiles. If a WRS-2 Landsat image is very cloudy, the AOT from a few remaining
  clear pixels might be used for the atmospheric correction of the entire image. The
  AOT that is used can be quite different from the value for the adjacent row in the
  same path, which results in an artificial abrupt change from one row to the next,
  as shown in Figure 4. This occurrence is very rare.  \n \n* Landsat WRS2 path/row
  boundary in cloud masks: The cloud mask algorithm Fmask creates mask labels by applying
  thresholds to the histograms of some metrics for each path/row independently. If
  two adjacent rows in the same path have distinct distributions within the metrics,
  abrupt changes in masking patterns can appear across the row boundary, as shown
  in Figure 5. This occurrence is very rare.  \n\n* Fmask configuration was deficient
  for 2-3 months in 2021: The HLS installation of Fmask failed to include auxiliary
  digital elevation model (DEM) and European Space Agency (ESA) Global Surface Water
  Occurrence data for a 2-3 month run in 2021. This impacted the masking results over
  water and in mountainous regions. \n\n* The reflectance “scale_factor” and “offset”
  for some L30 and S30 bands were not set: The HLS reflectance scaling factor is 0.0001
  and offset is 0. However, this information was not set in the Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF
  (COG) files of some bands for a small number of granules. The lack of this information
  creates a problem for automatic conversion of the reflectance data, requiring explicit
  scaling in applications. The problem has been corrected, but the affected granules
  have not been reprocessed. \n\n* Incomplete map projection information: For a time,
  HLS imagery was produced with an incomplete coordinate reference system (CRS). The
  metadata contains the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone and coordinates necessary
  to geolocate pixels within the image but might not be in a standard form, especially
  for granules produced early in the HLS mission. As a result, an error will occur
  in certain image processing packages due to the incomplete CRS. The simplest solution
  is to update to the latest version of Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)
  and/or rasterio, which use the available information without error. \n\n* False
  northing of 10^7 for the L30 angle data: The L30 and S30 products do not use a false
  northing for the UTM projection, and the angle data are supposed to follow the same
  convention. However, the L30 angle data incorrectly uses a false northing of 10^7.
  There is no problem with the angle data itself, but the false northing needs to
  be set to 0 for it to be aligned with the reflectance.\n\n* L30 from Landsat L1GT
  scenes: Landsat L1GT scenes were not intended for HLS due to their poor geolocation.
  However, some scenes made it through screening for a short period of HLS production.
  L1GT L30 scenes mainly consist of extensive cloud or snow that can be eliminated
  using the Fmask quality bits layer. Users can also identify an L1GT-originated L30
  granule by examining the HLS cmr.xml metadata file.\n\n* The UTC dates in the L30/S30
  filenames may not be the local dates: UTC dates are used by ESA and the U.S. Geological
  Survey (USGS) in naming their Level 1 images, and HLS processing retains this information
  to name the L30 and S30 products. Landsat and Sentinel-2 overpass eastern Australia
  and New Zealand around 10AM local solar time, but this area is in either UTC+10:00
  or +11:00 zone; therefore, the UTC time for some orbits is in fact near the end
  of the preceding UTC day. For example, HLS.S30.T59HQS.2016117T221552.v2.0 was acquired
  in the 22nd hour of day 117 of year 2016 in UTC, but the time was 10:15:52 of day
  118 locally. Approximately 100 minutes later HLS.S30.T56JML.2016117T235252.v2.0
  was acquired in the next orbit in eastern Australia.  \n\n     This issue also occurs
  for Landsat. For example, HLS.L30.T59HQS.2016117T221209.v2.0 was acquired on the
  same day as the first S30 example given above, but both on day 118 of 2016 locally.
  Adding to the confusion for L30, in the same region, Landsat 8 and 9 can each overpass
  once in one of the two adjacent WRS-2 Paths (91/92/93) over a two-day period on
  a local calendar, but based on UTC time, the two overpasses can appear to be on
  the same day. For example, in the following seemingly same-day pair, the second
  L30 is actually for day 168 locally:  \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T000407.v2.0
  \ \n     HLS.L30.T55GCN.2023167T235747.v2.0  \n     Bear in mind, the date peculiarity
  for the data occurs when the overpass time is during the late hours of a UTC day.
  \ \n\n* The atmospheric ancillary data from the wrong date was used for LaSRC: Related
  to the above, for eastern Australia and New Zealand, L30 and S30 surface reflectance
  on certain days was created using the atmospheric ancillary data from a date that
  was one day too early. The exact geographic extent of the affected HLS products
  and the impact on the surface reflectance quality are under investigation. Practice
  caution when using data with overpass times during the late hours of a UTC day.\n\n*
  Duplicates in L30: The Landsat 9 acquisitions from October 2021 to March 2023 in
  Landsat Collection 2 were reprocessed by USGS in March 2023. This reprocessing updated
  the overpass time by a fraction of a second for some scenes. Since HLS uses overpass
  time as part of the L30 filename, the older L30 granules were not automatically
  overwritten due to the different filenames. For example, the first L30 granule in
  the following pair originated from an older version of L1TP of Landsat 9 with the
  second granule originating from the reprocessed version.  \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182646.v2.0
  \ \nHLS.L30.T11SLC.2022166T182645.v2.0  \nThere are other causes of duplicate L30
  granules, but the overall number of duplicates is very small.\n\n* Poor Geolocation:
  A large amount of granules that were processed for May through July 2023 were created
  with L1GT input scenes which were deemed undesirable due to a poor geolocation issue.
  These granules were removed from the archive. (see the full list of removed [granules](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/2161/L30_L1GT_granules_May_July_2023.csv))\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n\n* Aerosol QA bits from the USGS Land Surface Reflectance
  Code (LaSRC) model output have been added into the Function of Mask (Fmask) data
  layer. The added two bits indicate the aerosol levels: high, medium, low, and climatology
  aerosol.\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials to retrieve this data: https://data.lpdaac.earthdatacloud.nasa.gov/s3credentialsREADME"
