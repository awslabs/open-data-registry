Description: "The last several hurricane seasons have been active with records being\
  \ set for the number of tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin.  These\
  \ record-breaking seasons underscore the importance of accurate hurricane forecasting.\
  \ Imperative to increased forecasting skill for hurricanes is the development of\
  \ the Hurricane Forecast Analysis System or HAFS. To accelerate improvements in\
  \ hurricane forecasting, this project has the following goals:\n<br /> \n<br />\
  \ \n1) To improve the HAFS. The HAFS is NOAA\u2019s next-generation multi-scale\
  \ numerical model, with data assimilation package and ocean coupling, which will\
  \ provide an operational analysis and forecast out to seven days, with reliable\
  \ and skillful guidance on hurricane track and intensity (including rapid intensification),\
  \ storm size, genesis, storm surge, rainfall and tornadoes associated with hurricanes.\n\
  <br /> \n<br /> \n2) To integrate into the Unified Forecasting System(UFS). The\
  \ UFS is a community-based, coupled comprehensive Earth system modeling system whose\
  \ numerical applications span local to global domains and predictive time scales\
  \ from sub-hourly analyses to seasonal predictions. It is designed to support the\
  \ Weather Enterprise and to be the source system for NOAA\u2019s operational numerical\
  \ weather prediction applications. The HAFS will be a part of UFS geared for hurricane\
  \ model applications. HAFS comprises five major components; (a) High-resolution\
  \ moving nest (b) High-resolution physics (c) Multi-scale data assimilation (DA)\
  \ (d) 3D ocean coupling, and (e) Observations to support the DA.\n<br /> \n<br />\
