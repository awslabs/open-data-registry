Name: NOAA's Coastal Ocean Reanalysis (CORA) Dataset
Description: |
  NOAA's Coastal Ocean Reanalysis (CORA) for the Gulf of Mexico and East Coast (GEC) is produced using verified hourly water levels from the Center of Operational Oceanographic Products & Services (CO-OPS), through hydrodynamic modeling from Advanced Circulation "[ADCIRC](https://adcirc.org/)" and Simulating WAves Nearshore "[SWAN](https://swanmodel.sourceforge.io/)" models. Data are assimilated, processed, corrected, and processed again before quality assurance and skill assessment with additional verified tide station-based observations.
