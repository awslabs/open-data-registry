Description: "This dataset includes *hourly* sea surface temperature and current data\
  \ collected by satellite-tracked surface drifting buoys (\"drifters\") of the [NOAA\
  \ Global Drifter Program](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp). The [Drifter Data\
  \ Assembly Center (DAC) at NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological\
  \ Laboratory (AOML)](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/data.php) has applied quality\
  \ control procedures and processing to edit these observational data and obtain\
  \ estimates at regular hourly intervals. The data include positions (latitude and\
  \ longitude), sea surface temperatures (total, diurnal, and non-diurnal components)\
  \ and velocities (eastward, northward) with accompanying uncertainty estimates.\
  \ Metadata include identification numbers, experiment number, start location and\
  \ time, end location and time, drogue loss date, death code, manufacturer, and drifter\
  \ type. <br /> <br /> Please note that data from the Global Drifter Program are\
  \ also available at [6-hourly intervals](https://doi.org/10.25921/7ntx-z961) but\
  \ derived via alternative methods. The 6-hourly dataset goes back further in time\
  \ (1979) and may be more appropriate for studies of long-term, low frequency patterns\
  \ of the oceanic circulation. Yet, the 6-hourly dataset does not resolve fully high-frequency\
  \ processes such as tides and inertial oscillations as well as sea surface temperature\
  \ diurnal variability. <br /> <br /> [CITING NOAA - hourly position, current, and\
