Name: FoMo - A Multi-Season Dataset for Robot Navigation in Forêt Montmorency
Description: >
  The FoMo dataset is a multi-season collection recorded in a boreal forest environment,
  featuring deep snow, off-road terrain, steep slopes, and highly variable weather.
  It provides synchronized multi-modal sensor data—including two lidars (RoboSense and
  Leishen), an FMCW radar (Navtech), stereo and monocular cameras, dual IMUs, wheel
  odometry, power data, calibration sequences, and precise ground-truth trajectories
  via GNSS-PPK fusion.
  
  Designed to support research on robust robot autonomy under adverse conditions, FoMo
  includes repeated traversals of six trajectories of varying complexity for long-term
  SLAM and odometry evaluation, as well as rich metadata such as one-minute weather
  station measurements.
  
  The dataset and its benchmarks are intended to challenge state-of-the-art SLAM,
  localization, traversability analysis, and multi-season robotics research.
