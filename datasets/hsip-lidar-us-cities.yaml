Description: The U.S. Cities elevation data collection program supported the US Department
  of Homeland Security Homeland Security and Infrastructure Program (HSIP). As part
  of the HSIP Program, there were 133+ U.S. cities that had imagery and LiDAR collected
  to provide the Homeland Security, Homeland Defense, and Emergency Preparedness,
  Response and Recovery (EPR&R) community with common operational, geospatially enabled
  baseline data needed to analyze threat, support critical infrastructure protection
  and expedite readiness, response and recovery in the event of a man-made or natural
  disaster. As a part of that, for some time, recurring LiDAR data was also being
  collected by a joint agreement of NGA and other federal agencies and the HIFLDS
  Working Group. The publicly released data excluded US Military Installation coverage,
  but it is provided in as is. These collects were acquired by contract using commercial
  collection companies. Some metadata information about the collection can be found
  at USGS at https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/Non_Standard_Contributed/NGA_US_Cities/Topeka_KS/NGA%20133%20US%20Cities%20Data%20Disclaimer%20and%20Explanation%20Readme.pdf
