Name: Automated Segmentation of Intracellular Substructures in Electron Microscopy (ASEM) on AWS
Description: The Automated Segmentation of intracellular substructures in Electron Microscopy (ASEM) project provides deep learning models trained to segment structures in 3D images of cells acquired by Focused Ion Beam Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB-SEM). Each model is trained to detect a single type of structure (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, golgi apparatus, nuclear pores, clathrin-coated pits) in cells prepared via chemically-fixation (CF) or high-pressure freezing and freeze substitution (HPFS). You can use our open source pipeline to load a model and predict a class of sub-cellular structures in naive FIB-SEM cells images. If required, a fine-tuning procedure allows a model to be trained on a small amount of additional ground truth annotations to improve a prediction on a naive dataset. Together with the trained models, we also provide the training, validation and test datasets.
