Name: Collection of open nation-scale LiDAR datasets
Description: |
  The goal of this project is to collect all publicly available large scale LiDAR datasets and archive them in an
  uniform fashion for easy access and use. Initial efforts to collect the datasets are concentrated on Europe and will
  be in future expanded to USA and other regions, striving for global coverage. Every dataset includes files in original
  data format and translated to COPC format. For faster browsing, we include an overview file that includes a small
  subset of data points from every dataset file in a single COPC file.
