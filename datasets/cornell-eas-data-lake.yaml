Name: 'Cornell EAS Data Lake'
Description: >
  Earth & Atmospheric Sciences at Cornell University has created a public data
  lake of climate data. The data is stored in columnar storage formats (ORC) to
  make it straightforward to query using standard tools like Amazon
  Athena or Apache Spark. The data itself is originally intended to be used for
  building decision support tools for farmers and digital agriculture. The first
  dataset is the historical NDFD / NDGD data distributed by NCEP / NOAA / NWS.
  The NDFD (National Digital Forecast Database) and NDGD (National Digital Guidance Database)
  contain gridded forecasts and observations at 2.5km resolution for the Contiguous
  United States (CONUS). There are also 5km grids for several smaller US regions and
  non-continguous territories, such as Hawaii, Guam, Puerto Rico and Alaska. NOAA
  distributes archives of the NDFD/NDGD via its NOAA Operational Model Archive and Distribution System (NOMADS)
  in Grib2 format. The data has been converted to ORC to optimize storage space
  and to, more importantly, simplify data access via standard data analytics tools.
