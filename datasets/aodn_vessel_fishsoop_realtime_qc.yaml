Description: "Fisheries Vessels as Ships of Opportunities (FishSOOP) is an IMOS Sub-Facility\
  \ working with fishers to collect real-time temperature and depth data by installing\
  \ equipment on a network of commercial fishing vessels using a range of common fishing\
  \ gear.\n\nEvery day, fishing vessels operate broadly across the productive areas\
  \ of Australia\u2019s Exclusive Economic Zone where we have few subsurface ocean\
  \ measurements. The FishSOOP Sub-Facility is utilising this observing opportunity\
  \ to cost-effectively increase the spatial and temporal resolution of subsurface\
  \ temperature data in Australia\u2019s inshore, shelf, upper-slope, and offshore\
  \ waters. The data is currently returned to each fishing boat in near-real time,\
  \ so skippers can relate their catches to temperature-at-depth information.  The\
  \ same data will also be collated to provide oceanographers with quality-controlled\
  \ data for ground-truthing coastal models and to improve analysis and forecasts\
  \ of oceanic conditions.\n\nThe IMOS funded data collection follows on from a Fisheries\
  \ Research and Development Corporation (FRDC) funded pilot project (2022-007) with\
  \ the University of New South Wales, Fishwell Consulting and IMOS. In the first\
  \ year of the project 32 commercial fishing vessels had been equipped with sensors.\
  \ They covered a range of fishing vessels, including scallop dredges, tuna longlines,\
  \ shark gillnets, otter board trawlers, lobster pots, fish traps, prawn trawlers,\
  \ squid jigs, and danish seines. We also had a pre-trial test with one boat the\
  \ year prior, with the sensor installed on a trawler."
