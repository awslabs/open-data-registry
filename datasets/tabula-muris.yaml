Description: "Tabula Muris is a compendium of single cell transcriptomic data from\
  \ the model organism *Mus musculus* comprising more than 100,000 cells from 20 organs\
  \ and tissues. These data represent a new resource for cell biology, reveal gene\
  \ expression in poorly characterized cell populations, and allow for direct and\
  \ controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues,\
  \ such as T-lymphocytes and endothelial cells from different anatomical locations.\
  \ Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic\
  \ droplet-based 3\u2019-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at\
  \ relatively low coverage, while the other, FACS-based full length transcript analysis,\
  \ enabled characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage. The\
  \ cumulative data provide the foundation for an atlas of transcriptomic cell biology.\
