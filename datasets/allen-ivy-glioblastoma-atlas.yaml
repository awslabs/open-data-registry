Description: 'This dataset consists of images of glioblastoma human brain tumor tissue
  sections that have been probed for expression of particular genes believed to play
  a role in development of the cancer.  Each tissue section is adjacent to another
  section that was stained with a reagent useful for identifying histological features
  of the tumor.  Each of these types of images has been completely annotated for tumor
  features by a machine learning process trained by expert medical doctors.
