Name: UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Project (UKB-PPP)
Description: The UKB-PPP is a collaboration between the UK Biobank (UKB) and thirteen
  biopharmaceutical companies characterising the plasma proteomic profiles of
  54,219 UKB participants. As part of a collaborative analysis across the
  thirteen UKB-PPP partners, we conducted comprehensive protein quantitative
  trait loci (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary
  genetic associations, of which 85% are newly discovered, in addition to
  ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-Europeans. We identify independent
  secondary associations in 87% of cis and 30% of trans loci, expanding the
  catalogue of genetic instruments for downstream analyses.
