Name: Cell Painting Gallery
Description: |
  The Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created using the [Cell Painting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560178/) assay. 
  The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. 
  The datasets can be used for diverse applications in basic biology and pharmaceutical research, such as identifying disease-associated phenotypes, understanding disease mechanisms, and predicting a drug’s activity, toxicity, or mechanism of action ([Chandrasekaran et al 2020](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/files/anne/files/141_Chandrasekaran_NatRevDrugDiscov_2020.pdf)). 
  This collection is maintained by the [Carpenter–Singh lab](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/) and the [Cimini lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).
  A human-friendly listing of datasets, instructions for accessing them, and other documentation is at the [corresponding GitHub page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery) about the Gallery.
