Description: "The Cell Painting Gallery is a collection of image datasets created\
  \ using the [Cell Painting](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27560178/) assay. \n\
  The images of cells are captured by microscopy imaging, and reveal the response\
  \ of various labeled cell components to whatever treatments are tested, which can\
  \ include genetic perturbations, chemicals or drugs, or different cell types. \n\
  The datasets can be used for diverse applications in basic biology and pharmaceutical\
  \ research, such as identifying disease-associated phenotypes, understanding disease\
  \ mechanisms, and predicting a drug\u2019s activity, toxicity, or mechanism of action\
  \ ([Chandrasekaran et al 2020](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/files/anne/files/141_Chandrasekaran_NatRevDrugDiscov_2020.pdf)).\
  \ \nThis collection is maintained by the [Carpenter\u2013Singh lab](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/)\
  \ and the [Cimini lab](https://cimini-lab.broadinstitute.org/) at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/).\n\
  A human-friendly listing of datasets, instructions for accessing them, and other\
  \ documentation is at the [corresponding GitHub page](https://github.com/broadinstitute/cellpainting-gallery)\
  \ about the Gallery.\n"
