Name: GLAD Landsat ARD
Description: The Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) created by the Global Land Analysis and Discovery Lab (GLAD) at the University of Maryland serves as a spatially and temporally consistent input for land cover mapping and change detection at global to local scales. The GLAD ARD represents a 16-day time series of globally consistent, tiled Landsat normalized surface reflectance from 1997 to the present operationally updated every 16 days. Only data from 2020 to present available on the AWS, older data is available through the UMD API.
