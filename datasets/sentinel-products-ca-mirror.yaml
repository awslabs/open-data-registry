Description: "The official Government of Canada (GC) \U0001F341 Near Real-time (NRT)\
  \ Sentinel Mirror connected to the [EU Copernicus programme](https://www.copernicus.eu),\
  \ focused on Canadian coverage. In 2015, [Canada joined the Sentinel collaborative\
  \ ground segment](https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Copernicus/Canada_joins_Sentinel_collaborative_ground_segment)\
  \ which introduced an NRT Sentinel mirror site for users and programs inside the\
  \ Government of Canada (GC). In 2022, the [Commission signed a Copernicus Arrangement\
  \ with the Canadian Space Agency](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/signature-copernicus-arrangement-between-canadian-space-agency-and-european-commission-2022-05-16_en)\
  \ with the aim to share each other\u2019s satellite Earth Observation data on the\
  \ basis of reciprocity. Further to this arrangement as well as ongoing [Open Government](https://open.canada.ca/en/about-open-government)\
  \ efforts, the private mirror was made open to the public, here on the AWS Open\
  \ Dataset Registry. Additional Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-6 products over Canada are\
  \ also retrieved from [EUMETSAT](https://eoportal.eumetsat.int/cas/login)."

UpdateFrequency: Sentinel-1 is an NRT dataset retrieved from ESA's [collaborative
  hub](https://colhub.copernicus.eu/) within 90 minutes of satellite downlink. Non-NRT
  Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 are also retrieved. Other sensors are updated as quickly
  as possible based on Canada coverage and availability at the source.
