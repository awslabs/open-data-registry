Name: BodyM Dataset
Description: |
  The first large public body measurement dataset including 8978 frontal and lateral
  silhouettes for 2505 real subjects, paired with height, weight and 14 body
  measurements. The following artifacts are made available for each subject.
    - Subject Height
    - Subject Weight
    - Subject Gender
    - Two black-and-white silhouette images of subject standing in frontal and side pose
    respectively with full body in view.
    - 14 body measurements in cm - {ankle girth, arm-length, bicep girth, calf girth,
                                  chest girth, forearm girth, height, hip girth, leg-length,
                                  shoulder-breadth, shoulder-to-crotch length, thigh girth,
                                  waist girth, wrist girth}
  
  The data is split into 3 sets - Training, Test Set A, Test Set B. For the training and
  Test-A sets, subjects are photographed and 3D-scanned by in a lab by technicians. For
  the Test-B set, subjects are scanned in the lab, but photographed in a less-controlled
  environment with diverse camera orientations and lighting conditions, to simulate
  in-the-wild image capture. Some subjects have been photographed more than once with
  different clothing in order to test robustness of the dataset.
