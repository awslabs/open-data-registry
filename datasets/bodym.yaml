    Title: Human Body Measurement Estimation with Adversarial Augmentation
    URL: https://www.amazon.science/publications/human-body-measurement-estimation-with-adversarial-augmentation
Description: "The first large public body measurement dataset including 8978 frontal\
  \ and lateral\nsilhouettes for 2505 real subjects, paired with height, weight and\
  \ 14 body\nmeasurements. The following artifacts are made available for each subject.\n\
  \  - Subject Height\n  - Subject Weight\n  - Subject Gender\n  - Two black-and-white\
  \ silhouette images of subject standing in frontal and side pose\n  respectively\
  \ with full body in view.\n  - 14 body measurements in cm - {ankle girth, arm-length,\
  \ bicep girth, calf girth,\n                                chest girth, forearm\
  \ girth, height, hip girth, leg-length,\n                                shoulder-breadth,\
  \ shoulder-to-crotch length, thigh girth,\n                                waist\
  \ girth, wrist girth}\n\nThe data is split into 3 sets - Training, Test Set A, Test\
  \ Set B. For the training and\nTest-A sets, subjects are photographed and 3D-scanned\
  \ by in a lab by technicians. For\nthe Test-B set, subjects are scanned in the lab,\
  \ but photographed in a less-controlled\nenvironment with diverse camera orientations\
  \ and lighting conditions, to simulate\nin-the-wild image capture. Some subjects\
  \ have been photographed more than once with\ndifferent clothing in order to test\
  \ robustness of the dataset.\n"
