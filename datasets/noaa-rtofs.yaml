Description: "NOAA's Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) provides\
  \ users with nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and forecast guidance\
  \ up to eight days of ocean temperature and salinity, water velocity, sea surface\
  \ elevation, sea ice coverage and sea ice thickness. <br /><br />\n\nThe Global\
  \ Operational Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS) is based on an eddy\
  \ resolving 1/12\xB0 global HYCOM (HYbrid Coordinates Ocean Model) (https://www.hycom.org/),\
  \ which is coupled to the Community Ice CodE (CICE) Version 4 (https://www.arcus.org/witness-the-arctic/2018/5/highlight/1).\
  \ The RTOFS grid has a 1/12 degree horizontal resolution and 41 hybrid vertical\
  \ levels on a global tripolar grid. <br /><br />\n\nSince 2020, the RTOFS system\
  \ implements a multivariate, multi-scale 3DVar data assimilation algorithm (Cummings\
  \ and Smedstad, 2014) using a 24-hour update cycle. The data types presently assimilated\
  \ include <br /><br />\n\n(1) satellite Sea Surface Temperature (SST) from METOP-B,\
  \ JPSS-VIIRS, and  in-Situ SST, from ships, fixed and drifting buoys <br />\n(2)\
  \ Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) from SMAP, SMOS, and buoys <br />\n(3) profiles of\
  \ Temperature and Salinity from Animal-borne, Alamo floats, Argo floats, CTD, fixed\
  \ buoys, gliders, TESAC, and XBT <br />\n(4) Absolute Dynamic Topography (ADT) from\
  \ Altika, Cryosat, Jason-3, Sentinel 3a, 3b, 6a <br />\n(5) sea ice concentration\
  \ from SSMI/S, AMSR2 <br /> <br />\n\nThe system is designed to incorporate new\
  \ observing systems as the data becomes available. <br /> <br />\n\nOnce the observations\
  \ go through a fully automated quality control and thinning process, the increments,\
  \ or corrections, are obtained by executing the 3D variational algorithm. The increments\
  \ are then added to the 24-hours forecast fields using a 6-hourly incremental analysis\
  \ update. An earlier version of the system is described in Garraffo et al (2020).\
