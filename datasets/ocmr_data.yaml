Description: OCMR is an open-access repository that provides multi-coil k-space data
  for cardiac cine.  The fully sampled MRI datasets are intended for quantitative
  comparison and evaluation of image reconstruction methods. The free-breathing, prospectively
  undersampled datasets are intended to evaluate their performance and generalizability
  qualitatively.
