Name: Ohio State Cardiac MRI Raw Data (OCMR)
Description: OCMR is an open-access repository that provides multi-coil k-space data for cardiac cine.  The fully sampled MRI datasets are intended for quantitative comparison and evaluation of image reconstruction methods. The free-breathing, prospectively undersampled datasets are intended to evaluate their performance and generalizability qualitatively.
