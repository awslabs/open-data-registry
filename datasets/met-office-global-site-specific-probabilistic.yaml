Name: Met Office Global Site-Specific Blended Probabilistic Forecast on a 2-year rolling archive 
Description: We have developed a new blended probabilistic forecast system that takes outputs from our Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. 
 This system blends multiple gridded forecasts using a probabilistic approach to produce a set of percentile forecasts for a range of surface weather variables.
 It also calculates a “most likely” weather type, out to a range of seven days, to produce site-specific forecasts.
 It is recommended for users who want to access site-specific forecasts in a probabilistic way, with the flexibility to select what data they need for their specific use.
