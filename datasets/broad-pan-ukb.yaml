Description: A multi-ancestry analysis of 7,221 phenotypes using a generalized mixed
  model association testing framework, spanning 16,119 genome-wide association studies.
  We provide standard meta-analysis across all populations and with a leave-one-population-out
  approach for each trait. The data are provided in tsv format (per phenotype) and
  Hail MatrixTable (all phenotypes and variants). Metadata is provided in phenotype
  and variant manifests.
