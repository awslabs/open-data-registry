Name: UK Biobank Pan-Ancestry Summary Statistics
Description: A multi-ancestry analysis of 7,221 phenotypes using a generalized mixed model association testing framework, spanning 16,119 genome-wide association studies. We provide standard meta-analysis across all populations and with a leave-one-population-out approach for each trait. The data are provided in tsv format (per phenotype) and Hail MatrixTable (all phenotypes and variants). Metadata is provided in phenotype and variant manifests.
