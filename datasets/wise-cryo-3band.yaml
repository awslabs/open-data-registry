Name: "3-Band Cryo Data | Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)"
Description: 'The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was a NASA Medium Explorer satellite in low-Earth orbit that conducted an all-sky astronomical imaging survey over four infrared bands from 2010-2011. The 3-Band Cryo Data Release contains 3.4, 4.6 and 12 micron (W1, W2, W3) imaging data that were acquired between 6 Aug and 29 Sept 2010 while the detectors were cooled by the inner cryogen tank following the exhaustion of the outer tank.'
