Name: CESM-HR
Description: >-
  This dataset provides several global fields describing the state of
  atmosphere, ocean, land and ice from a high-resolution (0.1o for the
  ocean/ice models 0.25o for the land/atmosphere models) numerical earth system
  model, the Community Earth System Model (CESM, https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/).
  Texas A&M University (TAMU) and National Center for Atmospheric Research
  together with international partners collaboratively carried out a large set
  of high-resolution climate simulations, including a 500-year long
  preindustrial control simulation (PI-CTRL) described here. The CESM uses
  dynamic equations with a climatological (observations, long-term averaged)
  initial state of the earth system and the preindustrial greenhouse gas forcing
  (kept constant at the 1850 conditions) for making this PI-CTRL. Compared to
  standard low-resolution (1o) CMIP-class simulations, this high-resolution
  simulation dataset enables researchers to explore the contribution from
  processes at a wide range of spatial scales, from mesoscales to global scales,
  in shaping various observed climate phenomena with better accuracy.

UpdateFrequency: >-
  Rare. The CESM-HR PI-CTRL experiment is complete. Updates are expected only if
  any issues with the copy of the data on the AWS is reported in the future.
  Other experiments will be shared in the future according to the availability
  of resources.
