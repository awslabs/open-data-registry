Name: DOE's Water Power Technology Office's (WPTO) US Wave dataset
Description: |
  Released to the public as part of the Department of Energy's Open Energy Data Initiative,
  this is the highest resolution publicly available long-term wave hindcast
  dataset that – when complete – will cover the entire U.S. Exclusive Economic
  Zone (EEZ).
