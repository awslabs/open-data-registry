Name: OPERA Land Surface Disturbance Annual from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 product (Version 1)
Description: "The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis
  ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) Land Surface Disturbance Annual from
  Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) product Version 1 summarizes the [DIST-ALERT](https://doi.org/10.5067/SNWG/OPERA_L3_DIST-ALERT-HLS_V1.001)
  data product into an annual vegetation disturbance data product. Vegetation disturbance
  is mapped when there is an indicated decrease in vegetation cover within an HLS
  Version 2 pixel. The product also provides auxiliary generic disturbance information
  as determined from the variations of the reflectance through the DIST-ALERT scenes
  to provide information about more general disturbance trends. The DIST-ANN product
  tracks changes at the annual scale, aggregating changes identified in the DIST-ALERT
  product. Only confirmed disturbances from the associated year are reported together
  with the date of initial disturbance. As confirmed disturbances are determined using
  subsequent cloud-free observations to determine if the loss detections persist,
  the required number of HLS scenes depends on visibility of the target. Due to this
  dependency, summarizing the DIST-ALERT in the DIST-ANN product will have some latency
  contingent on the algorithmic calibration and is detailed in the Algorithm Theoretical
  Basis Document (ATBD).\n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ANN-HLS (or DIST-ANN) data product is
  provided in Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) format, and each layer is distributed
  as a separate COG. There are 21 layers contained within the DIST-ANN product: vegetation
  disturbance status, historical vegetation cover indicator, maximum vegetation cover
  indicator, maximum vegetation anomaly value, vegetation disturbance confidence layer,
  date of initial vegetation disturbance, number of detected vegetation loss anomalies,
  vegetation disturbance duration, date of last observation assessed for vegetation
  disturbance, and several generic disturbance layers. Each product layer is gridded
  to the same resolution and tiling system as HLS V2: 30 meter (m) and Military Grid
  Reference System (MGRS). See the Product Specification Document (PSD) for a more
  detailed description of the individual layers provided in the DIST-ANN product.
  \n\nThe OPERA_L3_DIST-ANN-HLS product contains modified Copernicus Sentinel data
  (2020-2025).\n\nKnown Issues\n* Additional usage constraints are provided under
  Section 5 of the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD).\nRead our doc on how
