Name: Vesuvius Challenge - CT Scans of Herculaneum Papyri
Description: |
  Reconstructed micro-CT volumes of carbonized Herculaneum papyri produced for the
  Vesuvius Challenge. The scanned library of scrolls survived the volcanic eruption
  of Vesuvius in 79 AD and is the only "intact" library coming from ancient times.
  Volumetric reconstructions are distributed as OME-Zarr multiscale datasets to support
  virtual unwrapping, segmentation, and text recovery research on ancient scrolls.
  Reading these scrolls could change forever our knowledge of Roman History.
