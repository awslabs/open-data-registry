Name: Vesuvius Challenge - CT Scans of Herculaneum Papyri
Description: |
  This dataset contains reconstructed micro-CT volumes of carbonized Herculaneum papyri
  produced as part of the Vesuvius Challenge. The scanned scroll library survived the
  eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. It is the only intact library known to have
  survived from antiquity.
  The volumetric reconstructions are distributed as OME-Zarr multiscale datasets to support
  research in virtual unwrapping, segmentation, and text recovery of ancient scrolls.
  Deciphering these scrolls could forever change our understanding of Roman history.
