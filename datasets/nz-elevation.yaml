Name: New Zealand Elevation
Description: |
  The New Zealand Elevation dataset consists of New Zealand's publicly owned digital elevation models and digital surface models, which are freely available to use under an open licence. The dataset contains 1m resolution grids derived from LiDAR data. Point clouds are not included in the initial release.

  All of the elevation files are [Cloud Optimised GeoTIFFs](https://www.cogeo.org/) using LERC compression for the main grid and LERC compression with lower max_z_error for the overviews. These elevation files are accompanied by [STAC metadata](https://stacspec.org/). The elevation data is organised by region and survey.
