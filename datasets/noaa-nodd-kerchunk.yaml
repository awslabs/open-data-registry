Description: "This repository contains references to datasets published to the NOAA\
  \ Open Data Dissemination Program. These reference datasets serve as index files\
  \ to the original data by mapping to the [Zarr V2 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2/v2.0.html).\
  \ When multidimensional model output is read through zarr, data can be lazily loaded\
  \ (i.e. retrieving only the data chunks needed for processing) and data reads can\
  \ be scaled horizontally to optimize object storage read performance. \n<br/>\n\
  <br/>\nThe process used to optimize the data is called [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/).\
  \ RPS runs [the workflow](https://asascience-open.github.io/nextgen-dmac/ingest/ingest-prototype.html)\
  \ in their AWS cloud environment every time a new data notification is received\
  \ from a relevant source data bucket.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThese are the current datasets\
  \ being cloud-optimized. Refer to those pages for file naming conventions and other\
  \ information regarding the specific model implementations:\n<br/>\n[NOAA Operational\
  \ Forecast System (OFS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-ofs/)\n<br/>  \n[NOAA\
  \ Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-rtofs/)\n\
  <br/>  \n[NOAA National Water Model Short-Range Forecast](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nwm-pds/)\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\nFilenames follow the source dataset\u2019s conventions. For example,\
  \ if the source file is\n<br/>\nnos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc\n<br/>\n\
  <br/>\nThen the cloud-optimized filename is the same, with \u201C.zarr\u201D appended\n\
  <br/>\nnos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc.zarr\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Data Aggregations**\n\
  <br/>\nWe also produce virtual aggregations to group an entire forecast model run,\
  \ and the \u201Cbest\u201D available forecast.\n<br/>\nBest Forecast (continuously\
  \ updated) -  nos.dbofs.fields.best.nc.zarr\nFull Model Run -  nos.dbofs.fields.forecast.[YYYYMMDD].t[CC]z.nc.zarr\n\
  <br/>\n- CC is the model run cycles, 00, 06, 12, 18 , or 03, 09, 15, 21 for nowcast\
  \ and forecast runs\n<br/>\n- YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
