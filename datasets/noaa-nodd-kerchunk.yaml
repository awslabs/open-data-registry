Name: NOAA Cloud Optimized Zarr Reference Files (Kerchunk)
Description: |
  This repository contains references to datasets published to the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program. These reference datasets serve as index files to the original data by mapping to the [Zarr V2 specification](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2/v2.0.html). When multidimensional model output is read through zarr, data can be lazily loaded (i.e. retrieving only the data chunks needed for processing) and data reads can be scaled horizontally to optimize object storage read performance. 
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The process used to optimize the data is called [kerchunk](https://fsspec.github.io/kerchunk/). RPS runs [the workflow](https://asascience-open.github.io/nextgen-dmac/ingest/ingest-prototype.html) in their AWS cloud environment every time a new data notification is received from a relevant source data bucket.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  These are the current datasets being cloud-optimized. Refer to those pages for file naming conventions and other information regarding the specific model implementations:
  <br/>
  [NOAA Operational Forecast System (OFS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-ofs/)
  <br/>  
  [NOAA Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (Global RTOFS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-rtofs/)
  <br/>  
  [NOAA National Water Model Short-Range Forecast](https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-nwm-pds/)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Filenames follow the source dataset’s conventions. For example, if the source file is
  <br/>
  nos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then the cloud-optimized filename is the same, with “.zarr” appended
  <br/>
  nos.dbofs.fields.f024.20240527.t00z.nc.zarr
  <br/>
  <br/>
  **Data Aggregations**
  <br/>
  We also produce virtual aggregations to group an entire forecast model run, and the “best” available forecast.
  <br/>
  Best Forecast (continuously updated) -  nos.dbofs.fields.best.nc.zarr
  Full Model Run -  nos.dbofs.fields.forecast.[YYYYMMDD].t[CC]z.nc.zarr
  <br/>
  - CC is the model run cycles, 00, 06, 12, 18 , or 03, 09, 15, 21 for nowcast and forecast runs
  <br/>
  - YYYY = year, MM = month, DD = day
