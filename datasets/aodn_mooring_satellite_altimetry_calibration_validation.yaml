Name: Satellite - Altimetry calibration and validation
Description: "High precision satellite altimeter missions including TOPEX/Poseidon\
  \ (T/P), Jason-1 and now OSTM/Jason-2, have contributed fundamental advances in\
  \ our understanding of regional and global ocean circulation and its role in the\
  \ Earth's climate and regional applications. These altimeter satellites essentially\
  \ observe the height of the global oceans \u2013 as such, they have become the tool\
  \ of choice for scientists to measure sea level rise \u2013 both at regional and\
  \ global scales as well as giving information about ocean currents and large- and\
  \ small-scale variability. The determination of changes in global mean sea level\
  \ is of fundamental importance in understanding the response of the ocean to a continuing\
  \ warming climate \u2013 both through thermal expansion of the ocean, melting of\
  \ the major ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica, and mountain glaciers, and redistribution\
  \ of water over the continents and atmosphere. As with all scientific observations,\
  \ it is vital that the measurement tool is operating within its specifications \u2013\
  \ calibration and validation is therefore an important component in this regard.\
  \ \n\nThis IMOS sub-facility provides the sole southern hemisphere in situ calibration\
  \ site to provide an ongoing calibration and validation data stream directly to\
  \ the international (NASA and CNES sponsored) Ocean Surface Topography Science Team\
  \ (OSTST). This contribution, importantly, spans multiple altimeter missions, thus\
  \ enabling the assimilation of multi-mission satellite data to determine ongoing\
  \ changes in sea level with flow-on effects to other uses of this data. The OSTST\
  \ collectively oversees the operation and calibration of the precision altimetry\
  \ missions, and ensures each of these missions is performing as accurately as possible\
  \ in order to meet mission objectives. The IMOS supported calibration site in Australia\
  \ is one of four primary in situ calibration/validation sites that contribute to\
  \ the OSTST. The remaining sites include Harvest (USA), Corsica (France), and Gavdos\
  \ (Greece). The Australian calibration site includes two comparison points where\
  \ in situ data is compared against the altimeter \u2013 Bass Strait and Storm Bay.\
  \ These two locations both lie on descending (N -> S) pass 088 of the satellite\
  \ altimeter, and thus share similar satellite orbit characteristics. The use of\
  \ these two sites allows detailed investigation into the accuracy of the altimeter\
  \ over two different wave climates. The average significant wave height at Storm\
  \ Bay is approximately double that observed at the comparatively sheltered Bass\
  \ Strait location. One of the ongoing issues with satellite altimeter missions is\
  \ the \u201CSea-state bias\u201D correction which is related to wave shape and height.\
  \ We plan to use the different wave climates at the two locations, coupled with\
  \ the fact that some other things (such as orbit errors) are the same at both locations\
  \ to improve the quality of this correction."
