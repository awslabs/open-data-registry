Description: "Tabula Muris Senis is a comprehensive compendium of single cell transcriptomic\
  \ data from the model organism *Mus musculus* comprising more than 500,000 cells\
  \ from 18 organs and tissues across the mouse lifespan. We discovered cell-specific\
  \ changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age related\
  \ changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic\
  \ data we were able to assess cell type specific manifestations of different hallmarks\
  \ of aging, such as senescence, changes in the activity of metabolic pathways, depletion\
  \ of stem-cell populations, genomic instability and the role of inflammation as\
  \ well as other changes in the organism\u2019s immune system. Tabula Muris Senis\
  \ provides a wealth of new molecular information about how the most significant\
  \ hallmarks of aging are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.See:\
