Name: 'SPHEREx: An All-Sky Spectral Survey'
Description: 'The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer (SPHEREx) is a NASA Astrophysics Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) mission launched in March 2025. During its planned two-year mission, SPHEREx will perform the first ever all-sky spectral survey in the optical to near-infrared (0.75-5 microns). SPHEREx data will be used to probe inflation and the early universe, trace the history of galactic light production, and investigate the origin of planetary systems and biogenic ices, in addition to contributing to many other astrophyics research topics.'
