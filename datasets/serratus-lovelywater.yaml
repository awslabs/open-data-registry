Name: "Serratus: Ultra-deep Search for Novel Viruses - Versioned Data Release"
Description: "Serratus is a collaborative open science project for ultra-rapid discovery of known and unknown coronaviruses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic through re-analysis of publicly available genomic data. Our resulting vertebrate viral alignment data is explorable via the [Serratus Explorer](https://serratus.io/explorer) and directly accessible on Amazon S3."
