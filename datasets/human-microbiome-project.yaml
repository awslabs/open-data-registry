Description: The NIH-funded Human Microbiome Project (HMP) is a collaborative effort
  of over 300 scientists from more than 80 organizations to comprehensively characterize
  the microbial communities inhabiting the human body and elucidate their role in
  human health and disease. To accomplish this task, microbial community samples were
  isolated from a cohort of 300 healthy adult human subjects at 18 specific sites
  within five regions of the body (oral cavity, airways, urogenital track, skin, and
  gut). Targeted sequencing of the 16S bacterial marker gene and/or whole metagenome
  shotgun sequencing was performed for thousands of these samples. In addition, whole
  genome sequences were generated for isolate strains collected from human body sites
  to act as reference organisms for analysis. Finally, 16S marker and whole metagenome
  sequencing was also done on additional samples from people suffering from several
  disease conditions.
