Description: A centralized repository of up-to-date and curated datasets on or related
  to the spread and characteristics of the novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) and its
  associated illness, COVID-19. Globally, there are several efforts underway to gather
  this data, and we are working with partners to make this crucial data freely available
  and keep it up-to-date. Hosted on the AWS cloud, we have seeded our curated data
  lake with COVID-19 case tracking data from Johns Hopkins and The New York Times,
  hospital bed availability from Definitive Healthcare, and over 45,000 research articles
  about COVID-19 and related coronaviruses from the Allen Institute for AI.
