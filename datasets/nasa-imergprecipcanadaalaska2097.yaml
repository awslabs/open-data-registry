Name: 'ABoVE: Bias-Corrected IMERG Monthly Precipitation for Alaska and Canada, 2000-2020'
Description: |-
  This dataset is a modification to the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) Final Run microwave-only, daily precipitation Version 06 data. It provides bias-corrected IMERG monthly precipitation data for Alaska and Canada from June 2000 through December 2020 in Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF (*.tif) format. Data are provided in the units of mm/day. NASA's IMERG data product is one of the most advanced satellite precipitation products with a 0.1-degree spatial resolution and near global coverage. This dataset bias-corrected IMERG's HQprecipitation precipitation estimates, which are based on passive microwave (PMW)-only retrievals, using a linear regression method. This method utilizes empirical measurements from rain gauge stations from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and a digital elevation model. This bias correction approach improves estimates at elevations above 500 m a.s.l., which are typically underestimated.
