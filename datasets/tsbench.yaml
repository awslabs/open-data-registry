Description: 'TSBench comprises thousands of benchmark evaluations for time series
  forecasting methods. It provides various metrics (i.e. measures of accuracy, latency,
  number of model parameters, ...) of 13 time series forecasting methods across 44
  heterogeneous datasets. Time series forecasting methods include both classical and
  deep learning methods while several hyperparameters settings are evaluated for the
  deep learning methods.


  In addition to the tabular data providing the metrics, TSBench includes the probabilistic
  forecasts of all evaluated methods for all 44 datasets. While the tabular data is
  small (about 10 MiB), the forecasts amount to almost 600 GiB of data.
