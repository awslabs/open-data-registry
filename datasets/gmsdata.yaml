Description: The Genome Institute at Washington University has developed a high-throughput,
  fault-tolerant analysis information management system called the Genome Modeling
  System (GMS), capable of executing complex, interdependent, and automated genome
  analysis pipelines at a massive scale. The GMS framework provides detailed tracking
  of samples and data coupled with reliable and repeatable analysis pipelines. GMS
  includes a full system image with software and services, expandable from one workstation
  to a large compute cluster.
