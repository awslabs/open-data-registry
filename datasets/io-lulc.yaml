Name: 10m Annual Land Use Land Cover (9-class)
Description: |
  This dataset, produced by Impact Observatory, Microsoft, and Esri, displays a global map of land use/land cover (LULC)
  derived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery at 10m resolution for the years
  2017 - 2021. Each year is generated from Impact Observatory’s deep
  learning AI land classification model using a massive training
  dataset of billions of human-labeled image pixels. The global maps
  were produced by applying this model to every Sentinel-2 scene,
  processing over 400,000 Earth observations per year. Leaders in governments, 
  NGOs, finance and industry need trustworthy,
  actionable information about the changing world to understand opportunities,
  identify threats, and measure the impacts of actions. Many of the most useful
  applications of LULC maps require the ability to measure changes in land use
  and land cover over time. With a time-series of LULC maps, monitoring of
  deforestation, urban expansion, agricultural land conversion, and surface
  water scarcity all become possible. The algorithm generates LULC predictions
  for 9 classes globally. These classifications include Built, Crops, Trees,
  Water, Rangeland, Flooded Vegetation, Snow/Ice, Bare Ground, and Clouds.
