Description: "This dataset, produced by Impact Observatory, Microsoft, and Esri, displays\
  \ a global map of land use/land cover (LULC)\nderived from ESA Sentinel-2 imagery\
  \ at 10m resolution for the years\n2017 - 2022. Each year is generated from Impact\
  \ Observatory\u2019s deep\nlearning AI land classification model using a massive\
  \ training\ndataset of billions of human-labeled image pixels. The global maps\n\
  were produced by applying this model to every Sentinel-2 scene,\nprocessing over\
  \ 2,000,000 satellite Earth observations. Leaders in governments, \nNGOs, finance\
  \ and industry need trustworthy,\nactionable information about the changing world\
  \ to understand opportunities,\nidentify threats, and measure the impacts of actions.\
  \ Many of the most useful\napplications of LULC maps require the ability to measure\
  \ changes in land use\nand land cover over time. With a time-series of LULC maps,\
  \ monitoring of\ndeforestation, urban expansion, agricultural land conversion, and\
  \ surface\nwater scarcity all become possible. The algorithm generates LULC predictions\n\
  for 9 classes globally. These classifications include Built, Crops, Trees,\nWater,\
  \ Rangeland, Flooded Vegetation, Snow/Ice, Bare Ground, and Clouds. \n"
