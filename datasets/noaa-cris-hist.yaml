Name: NOAA nClimGrid and Livneh Gridded Historical Climate Observation Thresholds
Description: |
  Livneh and nClimGrid are gridded observed historical climatology data that were used in the LOCA2 and STAR-ESDM downscaling process of global climate models as part of the 5th National Climate Assessment. The original Livneh and nClimGrid daily temperature and precipitation observations have been converted to a series of decision-relevant thresholds as part of the [(U.S. Climate Resilience Information System (CRIS))](https://cris.climate.gov/pages/about). These thresholds, such as days with extreme heat or precipitation, have been calculated to match the future projections from LOCA2 and STAR, also available in CRIS.
