Name: Satellite - Nighttime AusTemp - Degree Heating Days DHD grids for the Australian Maritime Region
Description: >-
  This dataset contains the summer Degree Heating Days (DHD) from the 1st of December
  to the 30th of April since 2012, which is calculated by accumulating the daily
  positive Sea Surface Temperature anomalies (SSTa). The SSTa is calculated by
  comparing the current SST to long-term averages (1993-2003, the "CSIRO Legacy
  climatology" or 2002-2011, the "IMOS climatology"). The magnitude of the DHD
  correlates well with past coral bleaching events. In cases where SST 
  cannot be calculated due to cloud cover, the grid cell is left blank (white 
  in web plots, transparent in Google Earth) to indicate missing data.
