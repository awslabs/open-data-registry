Name: "Emory Knee Radiograph (MRKR) dataset"
Description: |
  The Emory Knee Radiograph (MRKR) dataset is a large, demographically diverse collection of
  503,261 knee radiographs from 83,011 patients, 40% of which are African American. This dataset
  provides imaging data in DICOM format along with detailed clinical information, including patient-
  reported pain scores, diagnostic codes, and procedural codes, which are not commonly available in
  similar datasets. The MRKR dataset also features imaging metadata such as image laterality, view type,
  and presence of hardware, enhancing its value for research and model development. MRKR addresses
  significant gaps in existing datasets by offering a more representative sample for studying osteoarthritis
  and related outcomes, particularly among minority populations, thereby providing a valuable resource
  for clinicians and researchers.
