Name: NCBI SRA Gene Feature RNA-Seq counts
Description: "The NIH Sequence Read Archive (SRA), hosted by the [National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) stores sequencing data and alignment information from high-throughput next-generation sequencing platforms. SRA has conducted gene expression analysis of publicly released human and mouse RNA-Seq experiments to process raw RNA-seq reads into concise formats that summarize the expression results. The un-normalized feature counts for each SRA record are available in tab-delimited (*.tsv) format. The tsv files include two columns, the gene id and count. These counts facilitate differential gene expression analyses, particularly across studies and the entirety of the SRA corpus."
