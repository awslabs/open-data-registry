Name: Brain Data Science Database 3
Description: This collection unifies multiple brain datasets spanning critical care, sleep medicine, cardiopulmonary health, infectious diseases, and other aspects of clinical neuroscience. It includes large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) and polysomnography (PSG) recordings, brain imaging data (MRI, CT, PET), and electronic health records (EHR) data supporting research in areas such as epilepsy, delirium, coma, sleep depth, sleep-related breathing disorders, burst suppression, meditation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, and neuroinfectious diseases. All data is de-identified and includes algorithmic tools and reproducible code. Access requires (1) submitting proof of CITI training certification (research ethics training for human subjects research - see https://bdsp.io/about/citi-course/); (2) signing a data use agreement that prohibits re-identification, requires data security, restricts sharing, limits use to non-commercial research, and mandates reporting any potentially identifying information.
