    ', Description: 'The Real-Time Mesoscale Analysis (RTMA) is a NOAA National Centers
    For Environmental Prediction (NCEP) high-spatial and temporal resolution analysis/assimilation
    system for near-surf ace weather conditions. Its main component is the NCEP/EMC
    Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) system applied in two-dimensional variational
    mode to assimilate conventional and satellite-derived observations.<br/><br/>

    The RTMA was developed to support NDFD operations and provide field forecasters
    with high quality analyses for nowcasting, situational awareness, and forecast
    verification purposes. The system produces hourly analyses at 2. 5 km resolution
    for the Conus NDFD grid, 3 km for the Alaska NDFD grid and 2.5 km for the Hawaii,
    Puerto-Rico and Guam NDFD grids.<br/><br/>

    Data is available from the start of 2019 until present. URMA is a time lagged
    version of this product and is updated when new observations come in.
