Name: NASA High Energy Astrophysics Mission Data 
Description: |
    NASA data for high energy astrophysics (generally x-ray
    and gamma-ray domains) is made available here by the High Energy
    Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. The HEASARC hosts the
    full data archives of over 30 different missions spanning 50
    years. The data archive for each mission will contain a range of data
    types from spacecraft housekeeping and raw photon event list data up
    to high level science-ready products such as images, light curves
    (time series), and energy spectra.
    <br/><br/>
    This is a relatively modest total data volume but contains significant
    complexity and heterogeneity among the different missions.  Data
    provided here are stored in the Flexible Image Transport System
    ([FITS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html)) format
    common in astronomy.  Higher level products are further defined to be
    consistent between missions following [data model
    standards](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/ofwg_recomm.html)
    agreed by the community and maintained by the HEASARC.  Analysis of
    these data may require software also provided by HEASARC, the [HEASoft
    package](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/),
    consisting of tools generic to all FITS data, generic to all
    HEASARC-compliant data, and/or specific to individual missions as
    appropriate. Some missions provide standard science-ready data
    products, while others provide low-level data types and software to
    generate science-ready products from them. See the links for each
    mission for more information on how to use the data.
    <br/><br/>
    The [The HEASARC Website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) also has
    archive browsing tools where you can query for observations
    corresponding to temporal and spatial constraints among others.  These
    tools will ultimately point to files located on the archive by giving
    a URL beginning with the path https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/.  The
    data that are provided in the ODR follow the same structure, so when
    our tools give an https access URL, a user can simply swap in
    s3://nasa-heasarc/ for the first part of that URL and get a cloud
    URI. Note also that some selections have been made to what has been
    copied to the ODR, while the HEASARC archive itself remains the
    definitive and legacy source for the complete datasets.
    <br/><br/>
    The HEASARC also provides user support, both generic and
    mission-specific, through a set of email helpdesks available through
    the website's [Feedback
    page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback).
