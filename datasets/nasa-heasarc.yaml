Name: NASA High Energy Astrophysics Mission Data 
Description: |
  NASA data for high energy astrophysics (generally x-ray and gamma-ray domains) is made available here by the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center. The HEASARC hosts the full data archives of over 30 different missions spanning 50 years. The data archive for each mission will contain a range of data types from spacecraft housekeeping and raw photon event list data up to high level science-ready products such as images, light curves (time series), and energy spectra.
  <br/><br/>
  This is a relatively modest total data volume but contains significant complexity and heterogeneity among the different missions. Data provided here are stored in the Flexible Image Transport System ([FITS](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html)) format common in astronomy. Higher level products are further defined to be consistent between missions following [data model standards](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/ofwg/ofwg_recomm.html) agreed by the community and maintained by the HEASARC. Analysis of these data may require software also provided by HEASARC, the [HEASoft package](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/lheasoft/), consisting of tools generic to all FITS data, generic to all HEASARC-compliant data, and/or specific to individual missions as appropriate. Some missions provide standard science-ready data products, while others provide low-level data types and software to generate science-ready products from them. See the links for each mission for more information on how to use the data.
  <br/><br/>
  The [HEASARC Website](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/) also has archive browsing tools where you can query for observations corresponding to temporal and spatial constraints among others. These tools will ultimately point to files located on the archive by giving a URL beginning with the path https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/FTP/. The data that are provided in the ODR follow the same structure, so when our tools give an https access URL, a user can simply swap in s3://nasa-heasarc/ for the first part of that URL and get a cloud URI. Note also that some selections have been made to what has been copied to the ODR, while the HEASARC archive itself remains the definitive and legacy source for the complete datasets.
  <br/><br/>
  The HEASARC also provides user support, both generic and mission-specific, through a set of email helpdesks available through the website's [Feedback page](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/Feedback).
