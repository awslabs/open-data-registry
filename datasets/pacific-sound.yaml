Name: Pacific Ocean Sound Recordings
Description: |
  This project offers passive acoustic data (sound recordings) from a deep-ocean environment off central California.  Recording began in July 2015, has been nearly continuous, and is ongoing.  These resources are intended for applications
  in ocean soundscape research, education, and the arts.
