Name: Pacific Ocean Sound Recordings
Description: |
  This project provides three resources - passive acoustic data (sound recordings) from a deep-ocean environment
  of central California, derived data products, and analysis tools.  These resources are intended for applications
  in ocean soundscape research, education, and the arts.
