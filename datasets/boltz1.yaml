Name: Boltz-1 Training Data
Description: |
  This is the data used to train the Boltz-1 model. It contains the following datasets:
    - Our pre-processed version of the Protein Data Bank
    - Our pre-processed version of the multiple sequence alignment data for each protein chain
    - The raw multiple sequence alginment data.
    - A pre-computed symmetry file for symmetry correction during training
