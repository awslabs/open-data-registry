Description: '[Sentinel-1](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1)
  is a pair of European radar imaging (SAR) satellites launched in 2014 and 2016.
  Its 6 days revisit cycle and ability to observe through clouds makes it perfect
  for sea and land monitoring, emergency response due to environmental disasters,
  and economic applications. This dataset represents the global Sentinel-1 GRD archive,
  from beginning to the present, converted to [cloud-optimized GeoTIFF format](https://www.cogeo.org/).'
