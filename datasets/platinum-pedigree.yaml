Name: Platinum Pedigree
Description: The Platinum Pedigree Consortium (PCC) is a collaborative project to create a comprehensive reference for human genetic variation using a four-generation, 28-member family (CEPH-1463). We employed five different short and long-read sequencing technologies to generate phased assemblies and characterize both inherited and de novo variation, including at some of the most difficult to genotype genomic regions such as tandem repeats, centromeres, and the Y chromosome. This extensive "truth set" is publicly available and can be used to test and benchmark new algorithms and technologies to better understand human genetic variation.
