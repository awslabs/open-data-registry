Description: 'The project presents Sea Around Us Global Fisheries Catch Data aggregated
  at EEZ level. The data are computed from reconstructed catches from various official
  fisheries statistics, scientific, technical and policy reports about the fisheries,
  and includes estimation of discards, unreported and illegal catch data from all
  maritime countries and major territories of the world.


  This project was the result of a work between Sea Around Us and the CIC programme,
  a collaborative programme between the University of British Columbia (UBC) and AWS.
