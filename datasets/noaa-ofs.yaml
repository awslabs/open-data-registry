Name: NOAA Operational Forecast System (OFS)
Description: The Operational Forecast System (OFS) has been developed to serve the maritime user community. OFS was developed in a joint project of the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/NOS/Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS), and the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO). OFS generates water level, water current, water temperature, water salinity (except for the Great Lakes) and nowcast and forecast guidance four times per day.
