Description: "ANNOUNCEMENTS: [NOS OFS Version Updates and Implementation of Upgraded\
  \ Oceanographic Forecast Modeling Systems for Lakes Superior and Ontario; Effective\
  \ October 25, 2022}(https://www.weather.gov/media/notification/pdf2/scn22-91_nos_loofs_lsofs_v3.pdf)\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\nFor decades, mariners in the United States have depended on NOAA's\
  \ Tide Tables for the best estimate of expected water levels. These tables provide\
  \ accurate predictions of the astronomical tide (i.e., the change in water level\
  \ due to the gravitational effects of the moon and sun and the rotation of the Earth);\
  \ however, they cannot predict water-level changes due to wind, atmospheric pressure,\
  \ and river flow, which are often significant.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe National Ocean\
  \ Service (NOS) has the mission and mandate to provide guidance and information\
  \ to support navigation and coastal needs. To support this mission, NOS has been\
  \ developing and implementing hydrodynamic model-based [Operational Forecast Systems](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/forecast_info.html).\
  \ \n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis forecast guidance provides oceanographic information that\
  \ helps mariners safely navigate their local waters. This national network of hydrodynamic\
  \ models provides users with operational nowcast and forecast guidance (out to 48\
  \ \u2013 120 hours) on parameters such as water levels, water temperature, salinity,\
  \ and currents. These forecast systems are implemented in critical ports, harbors,\
  \ estuaries, Great Lakes and coastal waters of the United States, and form a national\
  \ backbone of real-time data, tidal predictions, data management and operational\
  \ modeling.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNowcasts and forecasts are scientific predictions about\
  \ the present and future states of water levels (and possibly currents and other\
  \ relevant oceanographic variables, such as salinity and temperature) in a coastal\
  \ area. These predictions rely on either observed data or forecasts from a numerical\
  \ model. A nowcast incorporates recent (and often near real-time) observed meteorological,\
  \ oceanographic, and/or river flow rate data. A nowcast covers the period from the\
  \ recent past (e.g., the past few days) to the present, and it can make predictions\
  \ for locations where observational data are not available. A forecast incorporates\
  \ meteorological, oceanographic, and/or river flow rate forecasts and makes predictions\
  \ for times where observational data will not be available. A forecast is usually\
  \ initiated by the results of a nowcast.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOFS generally runs four\
  \ times per day (every 6 hours) on NOAA's Weather and Climate Operational Supercomputing\
  \ Systems (WCOSS) in a standard Coastal Ocean Modeling Framework (COMF) developed\
  \ by the [Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services (CO-OPS)](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/).\
  \ COMF is a set of standards and tools for developing and maintaining NOS\u2019\
  s hydrodynamic model\u2013based operational forecast systems. The goal of COMF is\
  \ to provide a standard and comprehensive software infrastructure to enhance ease\
  \ of use, performance, portability, and interoperability of NOS\u2019s operational\
  \ forecast systems.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"
