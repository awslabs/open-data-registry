    Title: Evaluating Humorous Response Generation to Playful Shopping Requests
    URL: https://ecir2023.org/
Description: "This dataset provides a set of non-shoppable items, which are items\
  \ that can't be purchased via a virtual assistant (love, vampires, etc). \nIn addition,\
  \ for each non-shoppable item, the dataset contains humorous responses generated\
  \ by two different large language models, and a template-based generation solution\
  \ that uses a commonsense knowledge graph called ConceptNet.\nFinally, each row\
  \ contains a score provided by human annotators that judge how funny each response\
  \ is.\nThe columns provided for each datapoint are as follows:\nquestion- purchase\
  \ request of the non-shoppable item\nanswer- a generated response\nmodel- the name\
  \ of the model or solution that generated the response\nnon_shoppable_item- the\
  \ name of the non shoppable item\nrelation- commonsense relation that was used to\
  \ generate the response in the template-based approach\nprompt_or_template- the\
  \ prompt that was used to generate the responses\nscore- the average response score\
  \ of the human evaluation\n"
