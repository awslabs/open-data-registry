Name: International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative (INDI)
Description: >
  This bucket contains multiple neuroimaging datasets that are part of the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative. Raw human and non-human primate neuroimaging data include 1) Structural MRI; 2) Functional MRI; 3) Diffusion Tensor Imaging; 4) Electroencephalogram (EEG)
  
  In addition to the raw data, preprocessed data is also included for some datasets.
  
  A complete list of the available datasets can be seen in the documentation lonk provided below.
