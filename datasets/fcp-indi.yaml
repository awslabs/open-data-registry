Description: "This bucket contains multiple neuroimaging datasets that are part of\
  \ the International Neuroimaging Data-Sharing Initiative. Raw human and non-human\
  \ primate neuroimaging data include 1) Structural MRI; 2) Functional MRI; 3) Diffusion\
  \ Tensor Imaging; 4) Electroencephalogram (EEG)\nIn addition to the raw data, preprocessed\
  \ data is also included for some datasets.\nA complete list of the available datasets\
  \ can be seen in the documentation lonk provided below. \n"
