Description: "The New Jersey Office of GIS, NJ Office of Information Technology manages\
  \ a series of 11 digital orthophotography and scanned aerial photo maps collected\
  \ at various years ranging from 1930 to 2017. Each year\u2019s worth of imagery\
  \ are available as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files and some years are available\
  \ as compressed MrSID and/or JP2 files.  Additionally, each year of imagery is organized\
  \ into a tile grid scheme covering the entire geography of New Jersey.  Many years\
  \ share the same tiling grid while others have unique grids as defined by the project\
  \ at the time."
