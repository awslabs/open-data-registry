Name: New Jersey Statewide Digital Aerial Imagery Catalog
Description: The New Jersey Office of GIS, NJ Office of Information Technology manages a series of 11 digital orthophotography and scanned aerial photo maps collected at various years ranging from 1930 to 2017. Each yearâ€™s worth of imagery are available as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files and some years are available as compressed MrSID and/or JP2 files.  Additionally, each year of imagery is organized into a tile grid scheme covering the entire geography of New Jersey.  Many years share the same tiling grid while others have unique grids as defined by the project at the time.
