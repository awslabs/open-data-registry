Name: Ocean Radar - Newcastle site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: 'The Newcastle (NEWC) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the Central
  Coast, New South Wales, an area subject to the variability of the East Australian
  Current (EAC) and its coupling with coastal winds, tides, and waves. In this area
  the EAC separates from the coast and generates several eddies which control the
  larval species and the higher marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.


  The NEWC HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding
  stations located at Sea Rocks (32.441575 S 152.539022 E) and Red Head (33.010245
  S 151.727059 E).  These radars operate at a frequency of 5.2625 MHz, with a bandwidth
  of 25 KHz, a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 6 Km.  Within the
  HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.'
