Description: "The South Australia Gulfs (SAG) HF ocean radar system covers the area\
  \ of about 40,000 square kilometres bounded by Kangaroo Island to the east and the\
  \ Eyre Peninsula to the north.  This is a dynamic region where warm water from the\
  \ remnants of the Leeuwin current is moving from the west, and water with varying\
  \ density is exchanging with Spencer Gulf and the Gulf of St Vincent.  Upwelling\
  \ events occur from the deep ocean on the south side of the observation area.  This\
  \ is a key ocean area for aquaculture and fishing, and is a major shipping thoroughfare.\
  \  The data from this HF ocean radar system link the dynamics of the Great Australian\
  \ Bight to the Bonney Coast and on to Tasmania. \n\nSpecific research questions\
  \ identified by the SA Node of IMOS are: What is the detailed connection between\
  \ shelf currents and the Flinders Current to non-regional influences (e.g. Southern\
  \ Ocean, WA)?  What is the nature of oceanic currents and processes (e.g. wave drift,\
  \ mixing, eddies) that drive both winter and summer cross and along shelf exchange\
  \ including the summertime upwelling systems and flushing of the gulfs?  How does\
  \ the ocean circulation, wave drift, eddies and environmental variability affect\
  \ the distribution of sediments, nutrients, the production of lower trophic levels\n\
  (phytoplankton and zooplankton), the dispersal of larvae that underpin productive\
  \ fisheries in the region and the effects of environment on aquaculture\n\nThe SAG\
  \ HF ocean radar is a WERA phased array system with 16-element receive arrays located\
  \ at Cape Wiles (34.943 S, 135.681 E) and Cape Spencer (35.294 S, 136.879 E).  These\
  \ radars operate at a frequency of 8.512 MHz, with a bandwidth of 33 KHz and a maximum\
  \ range of 200 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage area surface currents are measured.\
  \  Data are also collected from which wind directions and significant wave height\
  \ can be calculated.  \n\nMost of the capital was contributed by the South Australia\
  \ Research and Development Institute."
