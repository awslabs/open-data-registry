    Title: NDFD Product Spreadsheet (excel file)
    URL: https://noaa-ndfd-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/NDFDelem_fullres_202206.xls
Description: 'The National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) is a suite of gridded
  forecasts of sensible weather elements (e.g., cloud cover, maximum temperature).  Forecasts
  prepared by NWS field offices working in collaboration with the National Centers
  for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are combined in the NDFD to create a seamless
  mosaic of digital forecasts from which operational NWS products are generated. The
  most recent data is under the opnl and expr prefixes. A copy is also placed under
  the wmo prefix. The wmo prefix is structured like so: wmo/&lt;parameter&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/&lt;wmo-file-name&gt;
  The wmo filename codes can be deciphered using the spreadsheet in the root of the
  bucket.
