Name: NOAA National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD)
Description: |
  The National Digital Forecast Database (NDFD) is a suite of gridded forecasts of sensible weather elements (e.g., cloud cover, maximum temperature).  Forecasts prepared by NWS field offices working in collaboration with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) are combined in the NDFD to create a seamless mosaic of digital forecasts from which operational NWS products are generated. The most recent data is under the opnl and expr prefixes. A copy is also placed under the wmo prefix. The wmo prefix is structured like so: wmo/&lt;parameter&gt;/&lt;year&gt;/&lt;month&gt;/&lt;day&gt;/&lt;wmo-file-name&gt; The wmo filename codes can be deciphered using the spreadsheet in the root of the bucket.
