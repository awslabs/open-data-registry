Description: "The NIH Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research\
  \ Program\u2019s (\u201CKids First\u201D) vision is to \u201Calleviate suffering\
  \ from childhood cancer and structural birth defects by fostering collaborative\
  \ research to uncover the etiology of these diseases and by supporting data sharing\
  \ within the pediatric research community.\u201D The program continues to generate\
  \ and share whole genome sequence data from thousands of children affected by these\
  \ conditions, ranging from rare pediatric cancers, such as osteosarcoma, to more\
  \ prevalent diagnoses, such as congenital heart defects. In 2018, Kids First launched\
  \ the Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, charged with building a\
  \ large-scale data platform supporting clinical and genetic data from these patients\
  \ and their families in order to accelerate discovery and ultimately clinical impact.\
  \ Researchers can search, access, aggregate, and analyze these data through the\
  \ Kids First Data Resource Portal. Additionally, by using cloud-based individual\
  \ workspaces in CAVATICA, a data analysis and sharing computation platform, researchers\
  \ can cross-analyze Kids First data with data from other efforts, such as NCI\u2019\
  s TARGET program and consortia-based datasets like the Children\u2019s Brain Tumor\
  \ Tissue Consortium (CBTTC).\nKids First is made available on AWS via the [NIH STRIDES\
  \ Initiative](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/publicsector/aws-and-national-institutes-of-health-collaborate-to-accelerate-discoveries-with-strides-initiative/).\n"
