Name: Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program (Kids First)
Description: |
  The NIH Common Fund's Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program’s
  (“Kids First”) vision is to “alleviate suffering from childhood cancer and
  structural birth defects by fostering collaborative research to uncover the
  etiology of these diseases and by supporting data sharing within the pediatric
  research community.” The program continues to generate and share whole genome
  sequence data from thousands of children affected by these conditions, ranging
  from rare pediatric cancers, such as osteosarcoma, to more prevalent
  diagnoses, such as congenital heart defects. In 2018, Kids First launched the
  Gabriella Miller Kids First Data Resource Center, charged with building a
  large-scale data platform supporting clinical and genetic data from these
  patients and their families in order to accelerate discovery and ultimately
  clinical impact. Researchers can search, access, aggregate, and analyze these
  data through the Kids First Data Resource Portal. Additionally, by using
  cloud-based individual workspaces in CAVATICA, a data analysis and sharing
  computation platform, researchers can cross-analyze Kids First data with data
  from other efforts, such as NCI’s TARGET program and consortia-based datasets
  like the Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium (CBTTC).
