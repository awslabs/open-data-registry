Description: |
  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a multi-year survey that has discovered exoplanets in orbit around bright stars across the entire sky using high-precision photometry. The survey also enables a wide variety of stellar astrophysics, solar system science, and extragalactic variability studies. More information about TESS is available at [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/tess) and the [TESS Science Support Center](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/).
