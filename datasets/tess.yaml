Description: 'The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a multi-year survey
  that will discover exoplanets in orbit around bright stars across the entire sky
  using high-precision photometry.  The survey will also enable a wide variety of
  stellar astrophysics, solar system science, and extragalactic variability studies.
  More information about TESS is available at [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/)
