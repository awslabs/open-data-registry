Description: |
  The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a multi-year survey that will discover exoplanets in orbit around bright stars across the entire sky using high-precision photometry.  The survey will also enable a wide variety of stellar astrophysics, solar system science, and extragalactic variability studies. More information about TESS is available at [MAST](https://archive.stsci.edu/tess/) and the [TESS Science Support Center](https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/).
