Name: MODIS/Aqua Surface Reflectance Daily L2G Global 1km and 500m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The MYD09GA Version 6.1 product provides an estimate of the surface
  spectral reflectance of Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
  Bands 1 through 7, corrected for atmospheric conditions such as gasses, aerosols,
  and Rayleigh scattering. Provided along with the 500 meter (m) surface reflectance,
  observation, and quality bands are a set of ten 1 kilometer observation bands and
  geolocation flags. The reflectance layers from the MYD09GA are used as the source
  data for many of the MODIS land products. \n\nKnown Issues\n* Prior to the Aqua
  MODIS launch, Band 6 exhibited several anomalous detectors. Band 6 performance degraded
  seriously after launch and presently a majority of the Band 6 detectors are non-functional.
  Science users should read and use the non-functional detector flags and decide for
  themselves the optimum manner to handle non-functional detector \"gaps\" for their
  products. For complete information please refer to the [MODIS Characterization Support
  Team (MCST) website](https://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/time-dependent-list-non-functional-or-noisy-detector).\n*
  For complete information about known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land
  Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Aqua&as=61).\n\nImprovments/Changes
  from Previous Version\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
