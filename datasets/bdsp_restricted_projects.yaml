Name: Brain Data Science Database 2
Description: This collection unifies multiple brain datasets spanning critical care, sleep medicine, cardiopulmonary health, infectious diseases, and other aspects of clinical neuroscience. It includes large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) and polysomnography (PSG) recordings, brain imaging data (MRI, CT, PET), and supporting data to enable research in diverse areas of clinical neuroscience such as epilepsy, delirium, coma, sleep depth, sleep-related breathing disorders, meditation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, cardiac arrest, neuroinfectious diseases, and audiology. All data is de-identified and includes algorithmic tools and reproducible code. Access requires signing a data use agreement that prohibits re-identification, requires data security, restricts sharing, limits use to non-commercial research, and mandates reporting any potentially identifying information.
