Name: RADIANT Public Data
Description: >
  The Real-time Analysis and Discovery in Integrated And Networked Technologies (RADIANT)
  initiative seeks to develop an extensible, federated framework for rapid exchange of 
  multimodal clinical and research data on behalf of accelerated discovery and patient impact.
  Coordination and implementation of initial RADIANT deployments will leverage a network of 
  more than 35 partnered health care systems and participating patient families within the 
  Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN) and the Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC). 
  This data set is composed of public multi-modal data provisioned by RADIANT. The initial
  bolus of data is from CBTN and consists of clinical data extracted/abstracted from 
  electronic medical records, omic data such as genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics and
  radiology and pathology imaging data. Data are collected or generated as part of consent-based, 
  IRB-approved observational or interventional studies with the goal of making it available
  globally to researchers across a broad number of disciplines.

  Data is updated on a regular basis by the RADIANT teams to make data available as
  rapidly as possible.
