Name: Planette ERA5 Archive
Description: |
  The ERA5 archive provides a comprehensive record of global weather and climate from 1940 to present, 
  with multiple temporal aggregations for flexible analysis. This dataset is derived from 
  the ECMWF/Copernicus ERA5 reanalysis and includes daily means, rolling means (7-day, 30-day, 90-day), 
  and monthly/seasonal aggregations at 0.25°×0.25° global resolution. The Planette ERA5 archive stores 
  this data in cloud-native format (Zarr with icechunk) for efficient access and analysis.

  The dataset includes essential atmospheric variables at both surface and pressure levels, enabling a 
  wide range of climate analyses, from daily weather patterns to long-term climate trends. Daily means 
  are computed by averaging hourly ERA5 data, while longer temporal aggregations are derived from these 
  daily means.
