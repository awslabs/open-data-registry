Description: "The GraphCast Global Forecast System (GraphCastGFS) is an experimental\
  \ system set up by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce\
  \ medium range global forecasts. The horizontal resolution is a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude\
  \ grid (about 28 km). The model runs 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles.\
  \ Major atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential\
  \ height, specific humidity, and vertical velocity, are available. The products\
  \ are 6 hourly forecasts up to 10 days. The data format is GRIB2.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
  The GraphCastGFS system is an experimental weather forecast model built upon the\
  \ pre-trained Google DeepMind\u2019s GraphCast Machine Learning Weather Prediction\
  \ (MLWP) model. The GraphCast model is implemented as a message-passing graph neural\
  \ network (GNN) architecture with \u201Cencoder-processor-decoder\u201D configuration.\
  \ It uses an icosahedron grid with multiscale edges and has around 37 million parameters.\
  \ This model is pre-trained with ECMWF\u2019s ERA5 reanalysis data. The GraphCastGFSl\
  \ takes two model states as initial conditions (current and 6-hr previous states)\
  \ from NCEP 0.25 degree GDAS analysis data and runs GraphCast (37 levels) and GraphCast_operational\
  \ (13 levels) with a pre-trained model provided by GraphCast. Unit conversion to\
  \ the GDAS data is conducted to match the input data required by GraphCast and to\
  \ generate forecast products consistent with GFS from GraphCastGFS\u2019 native\
  \ forecast data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**The GraphCastGFS version 2 made the following\
  \ changes from the GraphcastCastGFS version 1.**\n<br/>\n1. The 37 vertical levels\
  \ model is removed due to the storage restriction and limited accuracy.\n<br/>\n\
  2. The 13 levels graphcast ML model was fine-tuned with NCEP\u2019s GDAS data as\
  \ inputs and ECMWF ERA5 data as ground truth from 20210323 to 20220901, validated\
  \ from 20220901 to 20230101. Evaluation is done with forecasts from 20230101-20240101.\
  \ The new weights created from the training are used to create global forecasts.\
  \ It is important to note that the GraphCastGFS v1 model weights obtained from Google\u2019\
  s DeepMInd were provided based on 12 timesteps training with ERA5 data, while the\
  \ GraphCastGFS v2 model weights resulted from training with 14 timesteps with GDAS\
  \ and ERA5 data that significantly increased the accuracy of the forecasts compared\
  \ with GraphCastGFS V1.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe input data generated from the GDAS data\
  \ as GraphCast input is provided under input/ directory. An example of file names\
  \ is shown below\n<br/>\n<br/>\nsource-gdas_date-2024022000_res-0.25_levels-13_steps-2.nc\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe files are under forecasts_13_levels/. There are 40 files under\
  \ each directory covering a 10 day forecast. An example of file name is listed below\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\ngraphcastgfs.t00z.pgrb2.0p25.f006\n<br/>\n<br/>\n*The GraphCastGFS\
  \ version 2.1 change log:*\n<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Starting from 06 cycle on 20240710,\
  \ the forecast length is increased from 10 days to 16 days.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease\
  \ note that this NOAA GraphCastGFS Model was produced using a code package released\
  \ by Google DeepMind. For information on Google DeepMind, please visit their github\
  \ page listed in the documentation and license sections of this page.\n"
