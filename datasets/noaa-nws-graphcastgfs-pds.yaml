Name: NOAA GraphCast Global Forecast System (GFS) 
Description: |
  The GraphCast Global Forecast System (GraphCastGFS) system is set up by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce medium range global forecasts. The model runs in two modes on different vertical resolutions; 13 and 37 pressure levels. The horizontal resolution is a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid (about 28 km). The model runs 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z and 18Z cycles. Major atmospheric and surface fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential height, specific humidity, and vertical velocity are available. The products are 6 hourly forecasts up to 10 days. The data format is GRIB2.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The GraphCastGFS system is a weather forecast model built upon the pre-trained Google DeepMind’s GraphCast Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) model. The GraphCast model is implemented as a message passing graph neural network (GNN) architecture with “encoder-processor-decoder” configuration. It uses an icosahedron grid with multiscale edges and has around 37 million parameters. This model is pre-trained with ECMWF’s ERA5 reanalysis data. The GraphCastGFSl takes two model states as initial conditions (current and 6-hr previous states) from NCEP 0.25 degree GDAS analysis data and runs GraphCast (37 levels) and GraphCast_operational (13 levels) with weights provided by GraphCast. Unit conversion to the GDAS data is conducted to match the input data required by GraphCast and to generate forecast products consistent to GFS from GraphCastGFS’ native forecast data.

  <br/>
  The input data for both modes generated from the GDAS data as GraphCast input is provided under input/ directory. One file is for 13 pressure levels and the other for 37 pressure levels. 
  Example of file names are
  <br/>
  source-gdas_date-2024022000_res-0.25_levels-13_steps-2.nc
  <br/>
  source-gdas_date-2024022000_res-0.25_levels-37_steps-2.nc
  <br/>
  One file is for 13 pressure levels and the other for 37 pressure levels. The 13 and 37 pressure level forecasts are under forecasts_13_levels/ and forecasts_37_levels/, respectively. There are 
  40 files under each directory covering a 10 day forecast. An example of file name is listed below
