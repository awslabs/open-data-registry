    Title: Examples and scripts to support users to download, visualize, and process
      the WAVEWATCH III output files
    URL: https://github.com/ricampos/gefswaves_reforecast
Description: "This is a 20-year global wave reforecast generated by WAVEWATCH III\
  \ model (https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3) forced by GEFSv12 winds (https://noaa-gefs-retrospective.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).\
  \ The wave ensemble was run with one cycle per day (at 03Z), spatial resolution\
  \ of 0.25\xB0X0.25\xB0 and temporal resolution of 3 hours. There are five ensemble\
  \ members (control plus four perturbed members) and, once a week (Wednesdays), the\
  \ ensemble is expanded to eleven members. The forecast range is 16 days and, once\
  \ a week (Wednesdays), it extends to 35 days. More information about the wave modeling,\
  \ wave grids and calibration can be found in the WAVEWATCH III regtest ww3_ufs1.3\
  \ (https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/WW3/tree/develop/regtests/ww3_ufs1.3).\n<br/><br/>\n\
  The 20 years of reforecast results were analyzed and quality-controlled. Three output\
  \ types are available\n<br/><br/>\n1) Global wave fields, in grib2 format, with\
  \ several variables including significant wave height, period, direction, and partitions;\n\
  <br/>\n2) Point output tables, in netcdf format, containing time-series of significant\
  \ wave height, period and direction, for 658 points (latitude/longitude informed)\
  \ at the positions of wave buoys;  and,\n<br/>\n3) For the same positions, spectral\
  \ outputs are available, in netcdf format, containing the full spectra (2D directional\
  \ spectrum).\n<br/>\nEach file refers to one forecast cycle with date (year, month,\
  \ day) written in the file name.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis effort has been funded by a\
  \ NOAA OAR/NWS Service Level Agreement (SLA) whereby NOAA/OAR supports R&D and transition\
  \ needed for mission delivery of climate\nservices within NWS. The SLA project is\
  \ led by NWS/NCEP/Ocean Prediction Center in collaboration with NWS/NCEP/Environmental\
  \ Modeling Center and NWS/NCEP/Climate \nPrediction Center. This is a project also\
  \ in cooperation with NOAA\u2019s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory\
  \ (AOML) and the University of Miami\u2019s \nCooperative Institute for Marine and\
  \ Atmospheric Studies (CIMAS).\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe following github repository has\
  \ examples and scripts to support users to download, visualize, and process the\
  \ WAVEWATCH III output files\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttps://github.com/ricampos/gefswaves_reforecast\n\
  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe reforecast simulations were generated on the supercomputer Orion,\
  \ which is funded via a grant from NOAA to support research activities in environmental\
  \  \nmodeling, including weather modeling and simulation\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhttps://www.noaa.gov/organization/information-technology/orion\n"
