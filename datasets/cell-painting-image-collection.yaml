Description: 'The Cell Painting Image Collection is a collection of freely

  downloadable microscopy image sets. Cell Painting is an

  unbiased high throughput imaging assay used to analyze

  perturbations in cell models. In addition to the images

  themselves, each set includes a description of the biological

  application and some type of "ground truth" (expected results).

  Researchers are encouraged to use these image sets as reference

  points when developing, testing, and publishing new image

  analysis algorithms for the life sciences. We hope that the

  this data set will lead to a better understanding of which

  methods are best for various biological image analysis

  applications.
