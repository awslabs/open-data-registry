Name: OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 Static Layers
  validated product (Version 1)
Description: |-
  The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1) Static Layers (RTC-S1-STATIC) validated product contains static radar geometry layers associated with the OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected (RTC) SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 (S1) (RTC-S1) validated product.  Due to the S1 missionâ€™s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers such as incidence angle, local incidence angle, number of looks, and RTC Area Normalization Factor (ANF) vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA RTC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static-layers generation algorithm.  Static layers are provided as single-band cloud-optimized GeoTIFF (COG) files, with map grid matching RTC-S1 products with the same burst ID.  The standard OPERA RTC-S1 product is derived from the original Copernicus Sentinel-1 (S1) interferometric wide (IW) single-look complex (SLC) data, provided by the European Space Agency, with a temporal sampling coincident with the availability of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B SLC data. The OPERA RTC-S1-STATIC and RTC-S1 products are provided at a near global scope (land masses excluding Antarctica).  The RTC-S1 products are available in the associated OPERA Radiometric Terrain Corrected SAR Backscatter from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version 1) dataset.
