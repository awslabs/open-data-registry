Name: "Sea Surface Temperature Daily Analysis: European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative product version 2.1"
Description: "Global daily-mean sea surface temperatures, presented on a 0.05Â° latitude-longitude grid, with gaps between available daily observations filled by statistical means, spanning late 1981 to recent time.  Suitable for large-scale oceanographic meteorological and climatological applications, such as evaluating or constraining environmental models or case-studies of marine heat wave events. Includes temperature uncertainty information and auxiliary information about land-sea fraction and sea-ice coverage. For reference and citation see: www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0236-x."
