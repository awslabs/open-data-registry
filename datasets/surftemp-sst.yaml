Description: "Global daily-mean sea surface temperatures, presented on a 0.05\xB0\
  \ latitude-longitude grid, with gaps between available daily observations filled\
  \ by statistical means, spanning late 1981 to recent time.  Suitable for large-scale\
  \ oceanographic meteorological and climatological applications, such as evaluating\
  \ or constraining environmental models or case-studies of marine heat wave events.\
  \ Includes temperature uncertainty information and auxiliary information about land-sea\
  \ fraction and sea-ice coverage. For reference and citation see: www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0236-x."
