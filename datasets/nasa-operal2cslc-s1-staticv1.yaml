Name: OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from Sentinel-1 Static Layers validated product (Version 1)
Description: |-
  The Observational Products for End-Users from Remote Sensing Analysis (OPERA) Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 (S1) Static Layers (CSLC-S1-STATIC) validated product contains static radar geometry layers associated with the OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex (CSLC) from Sentinel-1 (S1) validated product. Due to the S1 mission’s narrow orbital tube, radar-geometry layers vary slightly over time for each position on the ground, and therefore are considered static. These static layers are provided separately from the OPERA CSLC-S1 product, as they are produced only once or a limited number of times, to account for changes in the DEM, in the S1 orbit, or in the static layers generation algorithm. Each OPERA CSLC-S1-STATIC product is distributed as a Hierarchical Data Format version 5 (HDF5) file following the CF-1.8 convention containing both data raster layers and product metadata and corresponds to matching CSLC-S1 products with the same burst ID. OPERA CSLC-S1 products are available over North America which includes the USA and U.S. Territories, Canada within 200 km of the U.S. border, and all mainland countries from the southern U.S. border down to and including Panama. The CSLC-S1 products are available in the associated OPERA Coregistered Single-Look Complex from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version 1) dataset.
