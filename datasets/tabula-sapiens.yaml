Name: Tabula Sapiens
Description: |
  Tabula Sapiens is a benchmark, first-draft human cell atlas of over 1.1M cells from 28 organs of 24 normal human subjects. 
  This work is the product of the Tabula Sapiens Consortium. 
  Taking the organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment, and epigenetic effects, 
  and allows detailed analysis and comparison of cell types that are shared between tissues. 
  Our work creates a detailed portrait of cell types as well as their distribution and variation in gene expression 
  across tissues and within the endothelial, epithelial, stromal and immune compartments.
  We have built directly on our unique skills, experience, and data infrastructure from Tabula Muris and Tabula Muris Senis 
  to create a high-quality human reference dataset and portal at a 10-fold larger scale from these prior efforts.
  
  A critical factor in the Tabula projects is our large collaborative network of PIs with deep expertise at preparation of diverse organs, 
  enabling all organs from a subject to be successfully processed within a single day. 
  We have built the logistics and infrastructure capable of tracking hundreds of samples and thousands of 384-well plates 
  from tissue through sample prep, library construction and on to sequencing and ultimately computational 
  and expert cell annotation with tight quality control.
  
  Tabula Sapiens leverages our network of human tissue experts and a close collaboration with a Donor Network West, 
  a not-for-profit organ procurement organization. We use their experience to balance and assign cell types 
  from each tissue compartment and optimally mix high-quality plate-seq data and high-volume droplet-based data to 
  provide a broad and deep benchmark atlas.
  
  The first version of Tabula Sapiens contained nearly 500,000 cells from 24 organs of 15 normal human subjects.
  With the second version, Tabula Sapiens 2.0, we have built an integrated map of 28 tissues collected across 24 donors. 
  Nine new donors and four new tissues were collected and analyzed together with the original Tabula Sapiens 1.0 dataset. 
  All tissues and organs, with the exception of the respective reproductive organs, were profiled from both male (n=11) and female (n=13) donors. 
  The donor's age ranges from 22 to 74 years old, offering one of the most comprehensive molecular profiles of human tissues across the 
  adult lifespan (7 donors under the age of 40, 11 donors between 40 and 60, and 6 donors over 60 years of age).

  Our goal is to make sequence data rapidly and broadly available to the scientific community as a community resource and 
  we welcome collaborative interaction on the project and analyses. By accessing these data, you agree to cite our work as
