    Title: 'The Tabula Sapiens: a multiple organ single cell transcriptomic atlas
      of humans'
    URL: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abl4896
Description: "Tabula Sapiens will be a benchmark, first-draft human cell atlas of\
  \ two million cells from 25 organs of eight normal human subjects. \nTaking the\
  \ organs from the same individual controls for genetic background, age, environment,\
  \ and epigenetic effects, and allows detailed analysis and comparison of cell types\
  \ that are shared between tissues. \nOur work creates a detailed portrait of cell\
  \ types as well as their distribution and variation in gene expression across tissues\
  \ and within the endothelial, epithelial, stromal and immune compartments. \nA critical\
  \ factor in the Tabula projects is our large collaborative network of PI\u2019s\
  \ with deep expertise at preparation of diverse organs, enabling all organs from\
  \ a subject to be successfully processed within a single day. \nTabula Sapiens leverages\
  \ our network of human tissue experts and a close collaboration with a Donor Network\
  \ West, a not-for-profit organ procurement organization. \nWe use their experience\
  \ to balance and assign cell types from each tissue compartment and optimally mix\
  \ high-quality plate-seq data and high-volume droplet-based data to provide a broad\
  \ and deep benchmark atlas. \nOur goal is to make sequence data rapidly and broadly\
  \ available to the scientific community as a community resource. Before you use\
  \ our data, please take note of our Data Release Policy below.</br></br>\n\nData\

  \ to initial publication by the Tabula Sapiens Consortium and its collaborating\
  \ scientists. \nIf you wish to make use of restricted data for publication or are\
