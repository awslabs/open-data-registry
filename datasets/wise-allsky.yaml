Name: "All-Sky Data | Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)"
Description: 'The All-Sky Release includes all data taken during the WISE full cryogenic mission phase, 7 January 2010 to 6 August 2010, in 4-bands (3.4, 4.6, 12, 22 microns, i.e., W1, W2, W3, W4) that were processed with improved calibrations and reduction algorithms. The Single-exposure Image Sets consist of 1,491,686 calibrated 1024x1024 pix @2.75"/pix FITS image sets for the individual 7.7 sec (W1 and W2) and 8.8 sec (W3 and W4) WISE survey exposures. Each image set consists of four intensity images, noise maps, and bit-masks indicating pixel use status, one for each WISE band.'
