Name: "All-Sky Data | Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE)"
Description: 'The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) was a NASA Medium Explorer satellite in low-Earth orbit that conducted an all-sky astronomical imaging survey over four infrared bands from 2010-2011. The All-Sky Release includes all data taken during the WISE full cryogenic mission phase, 7 January 2010 to 6 August 2010, in the 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 micron bands (i.e., W1, W2, W3, W4) that were processed with improved calibrations and reduction algorithms.'
