Name: HCMI-CMDC Open Data
Description: |
  The Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI) is an international consortium that is generating novel,
  next-generation, tumor-derived culture models annotated with genomic and clinical data.
  HCMI-developed models and related data are available as a community resource. The NCI is
  contributing to the initiative by supporting four Cancer Model Development Centers (CMDCs).  CMDCs
  are tasked with producing next-generation cancer models from clinical samples. The cancer models
  include tumor types that are rare, originate from patients from underrepresented populations, lack
  precision therapy, or lack cancer model tools. Throughout the development process, the CMDCs
  utilize stringent internal QC measures to ensure both clinical and molecular integrity. These
  models are then annotated with clinical and genomic data and are available as a community
  resource.
