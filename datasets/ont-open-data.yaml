Name: Oxford Nanopore Technologies Benchmark Datasets
Description: >
    The ont-open-data registry provides reference sequencing data from Oxford
    Nanopore Technologies to support, 1) Exploration of the characteristics of
    nanopore sequence data. 2) Assessment and reproduction of performance
    benchmarks 3) Development of tools and methods. The data deposited
    showcases DNA sequences from a representative subset of sequencing
    chemistries. The datasets correspond to publicly-available reference
    samples (e.g. Genome In A Bottle reference cell lines). Raw data are
    provided with metadata and scripts to describe sample and data provenance.

  Additional datasets will be added periodically. Updates and amendents will
  be made to existing entries when algorithmic advancements are made (e.g.
  improvements to basecalling algorithms).

      Nanopore sequencing data of the Genome in a Bottle samples NA24385,
      NA24149, and NA24143 (HG002-HG004) using the LSK114 sequencing chemistry.      
      The direct sequencer output is included, raw signal data stored in 
      .fast5 files and basecalled data in .fastq file. Additional secondary
      analyses are included, notably alignments of sequence data to the 
      reference genome and variant calls are provided along with statistics
      derived from these.

      Using nanopore sequencing, researchers have directly identified DNA and RNA
      base modifications at nucleotide resolution, including 5-methylycytosine,
      5-hydroxymethylcytosine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine in DAN; and
      N6-methyladenosine in RNA, with detection of other natural or synthetic epigenetic modifications
      possible through training basecalling algorithms. One of the most widespread
      genomic modifications is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which most frequently occurs
      at  dinucleotides. Compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, the
      traditional method of 5mC detection, nanopore technology can offer many
      advantages

      CpG dinucleotides frequently occur in high-density clusters called CpG islands
      (CGI) and >60% of human genes have their promoters embedded within CGIs.
      Determining the methylation status of cytosines within CpGs is of substantial
      biological interest: alterations in methylation patterns within promoters is
      associated with changes in gene expression and disease states such as cancer.
      Exploring methylation differences between tumour samples and normal samples can
      help to elucidate mechanisms associated with tumour formation and development.
      Nanopore sequencing enables direct detection of methylated cytosines (e.g. at
      CpG sites), without the need for bisulfite conversion.

      Oxford Nanoporeâ€™s Adaptive Sampling offers a flexible method to enrich regions
      of interest (e.g. CGIs) by depleting off-target regions during the sequencing
      run itself with no upfront sample manipulation. Here we
      introduce Reduced Representation Methylation Sequencing (RRMS) to target 310 Mb of the
      human genome including regions which are highly enriched for CpGs including
      ~28,000 CpG islands, ~50,600 shores and ~42,700 shelves as well as ~21,600
      promoter regions.
