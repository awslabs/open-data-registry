Name: Oxford Nanopore Technologies Benchmark Datasets
Description: >
    The ont-open-data registry provides reference sequencing data from Oxford
    Nanopore Technologies to support, 1) Exploration of the characteristics of
    nanopore sequence data. 2) Assessment and reproduction of performance
    benchmarks 3) Development of tools and methods. The data deposited
    showcases DNA sequences from a representative subset of sequencing
    chemistries. The datasets correspond to publicly-available reference
    samples (e.g. GM24385 as reference human). Raw data are provided with
    metadata and scripts to describe sample and data provenance.

  Additional datasets will be added periodically. Updates and amendents will
  be made to existing entries when algorithmic advancements are made (e.g.
  improvements to basecalling algorithms).

      Nanopore sequencing data of the Genome in a Bottle sample GM24385.
      Multiple PromethION flowcells using both the R9.4.1 and R10.3 nanopores.
      The direct sequencer output is included, raw signal data stored in 
      .fast5 files and basecalled data in .fastq file. Additional secondary
      analyses are included, notably alignments of sequence data to the 
      reference genome are provided along with statistics derived from these.
