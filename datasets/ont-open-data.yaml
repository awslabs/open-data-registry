Description: 'The ont-open-data registry provides reference sequencing data from Oxford
  Nanopore Technologies to support, 1) Exploration of the characteristics of nanopore
  sequence data. 2) Assessment and reproduction of performance benchmarks 3) Development
  of tools and methods. The data deposited showcases DNA sequences from a representative
  subset of sequencing chemistries. The datasets correspond to publicly-available
  reference samples (e.g. Genome In A Bottle reference cell lines). Raw data are provided
  with metadata and scripts to describe sample and data provenance.

  Description: 'Nanopore sequencing data of the Genome in a Bottle samples NA24385,
    NA24149, and NA24143 (HG002-HG004) using the LSK114 sequencing chemistry.       The
    direct sequencer output is included, raw signal data stored in  .fast5 files and
    basecalled data in .fastq file. Additional secondary analyses are included, notably
    alignments of sequence data to the  reference genome and variant calls are provided
    along with statistics derived from these.

  Description: 'Using nanopore sequencing, researchers have directly identified DNA
    and RNA base modifications at nucleotide resolution, including 5-methylycytosine,
    5-hydroxymethylcytosine, N6-methyladenosine, 5-bromodeoxyuridine in DAN; and N6-methyladenosine
    in RNA, with detection of other natural or synthetic epigenetic modifications
    possible through training basecalling algorithms. One of the most widespread genomic
    modifications is 5-methylcytosine (5mC), which most frequently occurs at  dinucleotides.
    Compared to whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, the traditional method of 5mC detection,
    nanopore technology can offer many advantages

  Description: "CpG dinucleotides frequently occur in high-density clusters called\
    \ CpG islands (CGI) and >60% of human genes have their promoters embedded within\
    \ CGIs. Determining the methylation status of cytosines within CpGs is of substantial\
    \ biological interest: alterations in methylation patterns within promoters is\
    \ associated with changes in gene expression and disease states such as cancer.\
    \ Exploring methylation differences between tumour samples and normal samples\
    \ can help to elucidate mechanisms associated with tumour formation and development.\
    \ Nanopore sequencing enables direct detection of methylated cytosines (e.g. at\
    \ CpG sites), without the need for bisulfite conversion.\nOxford Nanopore\u2019\
    s Adaptive Sampling offers a flexible method to enrich regions of interest (e.g.\
    \ CGIs) by depleting off-target regions during the sequencing run itself with\
    \ no upfront sample manipulation. Here we introduce Reduced Representation Methylation\
    \ Sequencing (RRMS) to target 310 Mb of the human genome including regions which\
    \ are highly enriched for CpGs including ~28,000 CpG islands, ~50,600 shores and\
    \ ~42,700 shelves as well as ~21,600 promoter regions.\n"

UpdateFrequency: 'Additional datasets will be added periodically. Updates and amendents
  will be made to existing entries when algorithmic advancements are made (e.g. improvements
  to basecalling algorithms).
