Name: Interhemispheric Cortex Connectivity Microscopy Dataset
Description: >-
  This dataset contains high-resolution ExA-SPIM (Expansion-Assisted Selective
  Plane Illumination Microscopy) light-sheet imaging data of interhemispheric
  cortical connectivity in the mouse brain. Whole-brain volumes are acquired at
  near-isotropic sub-micron resolution following tissue expansion and clearing,
  enabling visualization and reconstruction of individual callosal projection
  neurons and their axonal arbors spanning both hemispheres. Data is stored in
  OME-Zarr format for efficient cloud-based access and multiscale visualization.
