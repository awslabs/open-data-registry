Name: Sentinel-2
Description: |
  The [Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) is
  a land monitoring constellation of two satellites that provide high resolution
  optical imagery and provide continuity for the current SPOT and Landsat missions.
  The mission provides a global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 5 days,
  making the data of great use in on-going studies. L1C data are available from
  June 2015 globally. L2A data are available from September 2016 over wider Europe
  region and globally since January 2017.
Documentation: Documentation is available for [Sentinel-2 L1C](https://roda.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-s2-l1c/readme.html) and [Sentinel-2 L2A](https://roda.sentinel-hub.com/sentinel-s2-l2a/readme.html).

ManagedBy: "[Sinergise](https://www.sinergise.com/)"
UpdateFrequency: New Sentinel data are added regularly, usually within few hours after they are available on Copernicus OpenHub.
