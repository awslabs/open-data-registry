Name: NOAA Unified Forecast System Subseasonal to Seasonal Prototype 5
Description: |
  The Unified Forecast System Subseasonal to Seasonal prototype 5 (UFS S2Sp5) dataset is reforecast data from the UFS atmosphere-ocean coupled model experimental prototype version 5 produced by the Medium Range and Subseasonal to Seasonal Application team of the UFS-R2O project. The UFS S2Sp5 is the first dataset released to the broader weather community for analysis and feedback as part of the development of the next generation operational numerical weather prediction system from NWS. The dataset includes all the major weather variables for atmosphere, land, ocean, sea ice, and ocean waves.
