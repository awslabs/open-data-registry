Name: GeoNet Aotearoa New Zealand Data
Description: GeoNet provides geological hazard information for Aotearoa New Zealand. This dataset contains data and products recorded by the GeoNet sensor network. The dataset currently include GNSS data and additional datasets will be added in the near future.
  GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data include raw data in proprietary and Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) and local tie-in survey conducted during equipment changes, more details can be found on '[the GeoNet geodetic page](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/types/geodetic)]' website.
