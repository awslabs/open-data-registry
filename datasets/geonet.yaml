Name: GeoNet Aotearoa New Zealand Data
Description: GeoNet provides geological hazard information for Aotearoa New Zealand. This dataset contains data and products recorded by the GeoNet sensor network. The dataset currently include GNSS data and additional datasets will be added in the near future.
  GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) data include raw data in proprietary and Receiver Independent Exchange Format (RINEX) and local tie-in survey conducted during equipment changes, more details can be found on [the GeoNet geodetic page](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/types/geodetic) website.
  Coastal gauge data include relative measurement of sea level measured by tsunami monitoring gauges. Raw and quality control data are provided in CREX format (Character Form for the Representtion and eXchange of metereological data), more details can be found on [the GeoNet coastal tsunami monitoring gauges page](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/types/tidal_gauges).
  Camera images data include webcam images from the GeoNet Volcano monitoring network and Built Environment Instrumentation Programme, more details can be found on [the GeoNet camera page](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/types/camera).
  Waveform data include raw data from weak and strong motion instruments of the GeoNet seismic networks, more details can be found on [the GeoNet seismic waveform page](https://www.geonet.org.nz/data/types/seismic_waveforms).
  Seismic data products include strong motion derived data, more details can be found on [the GeoNet Strong Motion products page](https://strongmotion.geonet.org.nz).
