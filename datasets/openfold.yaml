Description: Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for 132,000 unique [Protein Data
  Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB) chains, covering 640,000 PDB chains in total,
  and 4,850,000 [UniClust30](https://uniclust.mmseqs.com/) clusters. Template hits
  are also provided for the PDB chains and 270,000 UniClust30 clusters chosen for
  maximal diversity and MSA depth. MSAs were generated with HHBlits (-n3) and JackHMMER
  against MGnify, BFD, UniRef90, and UniClust30 while templates were identified from
  PDB70 with HHSearch, all according to procedures outlined in the supplement to the
  AlphaFold 2 Nature paper, [Jumper et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2).
  We expect the database to be broadly useful to structural biologists training or
  validating deep learning models for protein structure prediction and related tasks.
