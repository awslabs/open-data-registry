Name: OpenProteinSet
Description: Multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) for 132,000 unique [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB) chains, covering 640,000 PDB chains in total, and 4,850,000 [UniClust30](https://uniclust.mmseqs.com/) clusters. Template hits are also provided for the PDB chains and 270,000 UniClust30 clusters chosen for maximal diversity and MSA depth. MSAs were generated with HHBlits (-n3) and JackHMMER against MGnify, BFD, UniRef90, and UniClust30 while templates were identified from PDB70 with HHSearch, all according to procedures outlined in the supplement to the AlphaFold 2 Nature paper, [Jumper et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2). We expect the database to be broadly useful to structural biologists training or validating deep learning models for protein structure prediction and related tasks.
