Name: NOAA 3-D Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System for the Atlantic Basin (STOFS-3D-Atlantic)
Description: |
  NOAA's Surge and Tide Operational Forecast System: Three-Dimensional Component for the Atlantic Basin (STOFS-3D-Atlantic). STOFS-3D-Atlantic runs daily (at 12 UTC)  to provide users with 24-hour nowcasts (analyses of near present conditions) and up to 48-hour forecast guidance of water level conditions, and 2- and 3-dimensional fields of water temperature, salinity, and currents. The water levelÂ outputs represent the combined tidal and subtidal water surface elevations and are referenced to NAVD88 in general or geoid referenced where there is no NAVD88 coverage, e.g., Puerto Rico. <br /><br />
  STOFS-3D-Atlantic has been developed to serve the marine navigation, weather forecasting, and disaster mitigation user communities. It is developed in a collaborative effort between the NOAA/National Ocean Service (NOS)/Office of Coast Survey, the NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS)/National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Central Operations (NCO), and the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. <br /><br />
  
  STOFS-3D-Atlantic employs the Semi-implicit Cross-scale Hydroscience Integrated System Model (SCHISM) as the hydrodynamic model core. Its unstructured grid consists of 2,654,153 nodes and 5,137,229 triangular or quadrilateral elements. Grid resolution is 1.5-2 km near the shoreline, 200-550 m for the floodplain, and up to 10 m for both levees and some small rivers. Along the U.S. coastline, the land boundary of the domain aligns with the 10-m contour above NAVD88, encompassing the coastal transitional zone most vulnerable to coastal and inland flooding. <br /> <br />
  
  STOFS-3D-Atlantic makes uses of outputs from the National Water Model (NWM) to include inland hydrology and extreme precipitation effects on coastal flooding; forecast guidance from the NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) and High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model as the surface meteorological forcing; the tidal water level and currents from the FES2014 tidal database; and the subtidal water level, and subtidal three-dimensional water temperature, salinity, and currents from the NCEP Global Real-Time Ocean Forecast System (G-RTOFS) as the open ocean boundary forcing. <br /> <br />
  
  STOFS-3D-Atlantic forecast guidance output available here include NetCDF, GRIB2, SHEF, and GPKG files. Please see README documentation for more details.
