    Title: Policy-Driven Neural Response Generation for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue
      Systems
    URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12529?context=cs.CL
Description: "This dataset provides extra annotations on top of the publicly released\n\
  Topical-Chat dataset(https://github.com/alexa/Topical-Chat) which will help in reproducing\
  \ the results in our paper\n\"Policy-Driven Neural Response Generation for Knowledge-Grounded\
  \ Dialogue Systems\" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12529?context=cs.CL). \nThe dataset\
  \ contains 5 files: train.json, valid_freq.json, valid_rare.json, test_freq.json\
  \ and test_rare.json. \nEach of these files will have additional annotations on\
  \ top of the original Topical-Chat dataset.\nThese specific annotations are: dialogue\
  \ act annotations and knowledge sentence annotations.\nThe annotations were computed\
  \ automatically using off the shelf models which are mentioned in the README.txt\n"
