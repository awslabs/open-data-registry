Name: Enriched Topical-Chat Dataset for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Systems
Description: |
  This dataset provides extra annotations on top of the publicly released
  Topical-Chat dataset(https://github.com/alexa/Topical-Chat) which will help in reproducing the results in our paper
  "Policy-Driven Neural Response Generation for Knowledge-Grounded Dialogue Systems" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12529?context=cs.CL). 
  The dataset contains 5 files: train.json, valid_freq.json, valid_rare.json, test_freq.json and test_rare.json. 
  Each of these files will have additional annotations on top of the original Topical-Chat dataset.
  These specific annotations are: dialogue act annotations and knowledge sentence annotations.
  The annotations were computed automatically using off the shelf models which are mentioned in the README.txt
