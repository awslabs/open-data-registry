Description: |
      
      <p>
      The High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) is a NOAA real-time 3-km resolution,
      hourly updated, cloud-resolving, convection-allowing atmospheric model,
      initialized by 3km grids with 3km radar assimilation. Radar data is
      assimilated in the HRRR every 15 min over a 1-h period adding further
      detail to that provided by the hourly data assimilation from the 13km
      radar-enhanced Rapid Refresh.

      These datasets have been translated to cloud-optimized Icechunk Zarr format by <a href="https://dynamical.org">dynamical.org</a>.
