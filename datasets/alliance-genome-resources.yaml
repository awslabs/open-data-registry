Name: Alliance of Genome Resources
Description: The Alliance of Genome Resources is a consortium that integrates genomic, genetic, and molecular data from leading model organism databases including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio (zebrafish), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis (frogs), and human reference data. The Alliance provides comprehensive datasets including gene annotations, disease associations, expression data (bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq), protein and genetic interactions, orthology relationships, variants and alleles, and complete genome sequences with annotations. Data is organized into Alliance-wide integrated datasets and organism-specific collections, supporting comparative genomics, disease modeling, and functional genomics research.

Resources:
  - Description: Alliance-wide integrated datasets including disease associations, gene expression, molecular and genetic interactions, orthology relationships, gene descriptions, and variants across all Alliance organisms. Data is organized by release version (8.3.0/, 8.2.0/, etc.), then by data type, with organism-specific collections for FB (FlyBase/Drosophila), MGI (Mouse), RGD (Rat), SGD (Yeast), WB (Worm), XBXL/XBXT (Xenopus), ZFIN (Zebrafish), and HUMAN reference data. Available in TSV, JSON, and VCF formats.
