Name: Alliance of Genome Resources
Description: The Alliance of Genome Resources is a consortium that integrates genomic, genetic, and molecular data from leading model organism databases including Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Danio rerio (zebrafish), Mus musculus (mouse), Rattus norvegicus (rat), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis (frogs), and human reference data. The Alliance provides comprehensive datasets including gene annotations, disease associations, expression data (bulk and single-cell RNA-Seq), protein and genetic interactions, orthology relationships, variants and alleles, and complete genome sequences with annotations. Data is organized into Alliance-wide integrated datasets and organism-specific collections, supporting comparative genomics, disease modeling, and functional genomics research.

Resources:
  - Description: Alliance-wide integrated datasets including disease associations, gene expression, molecular and genetic interactions, orthology relationships, and gene descriptions across all Alliance organisms. Data organized by release version (8.3.0, 8.2.0, etc.) and data type. Includes combined data files and organism-specific collections for FB (FlyBase/Drosophila), MGI (Mouse), RGD (Rat), SGD (Yeast), WB (Worm), XBXL/XBXT (Xenopus), ZFIN (Zebrafish), and HUMAN reference data. Files are available in TSV, JSON, and specialized formats (PSI-MI TAB for interactions, VCF for variants).
