Name: NOAA Space Weather Follow-On Mission Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 19
Description: |
  <br/>  
  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite 19 (GOES-19) is the fourth and final satellite in the
  Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) – R Series, the Western Hemisphere’s most sophisticated weather-observing and environmental monitoring 
  system.
  <br/>  
  The GOES-R Series provides advanced imagery and atmospheric measurements, real-time mapping of lightning activity, and space weather observations. As a part of the
  Space Weather Follow On (SWFO) Mission, the GOES-19 spacecraft contains a Compact Coronagraph-1 (CCOR-1) instrument that produces 96 files per day per level in the
  FITS format. These data are produced by the CCOR-1 instrument aboard the GOES-19 spacecraft. The instrument observes broadband optical light that is scattered from
  coronal electrons and heliospheric dust. The spacecraft also produces daily auxiliary (telemetry and attitude) files in NetCDF4 format.
