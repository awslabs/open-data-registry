Name: 'Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF)'
Description: 'The Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) is a time-domain astronomy survey that uses the Palomar 48 inch Schmidt telescope and a custom-built wide-field camera to image the night sky in three photometric filters (g, r, and i). It is a fully-automated survey aimed at a systematic exploration of optical transient phenomena. It completes a scan of the observable northern sky approximately every three nights.'

Resources:
  - Description: 'Objects Table is a catalog of PSF-fit photometry detections extracted from ZTF reference images. The reference images were generated by stacking single exposures acquired from all science programs in the survey, resulting in photometry up to 2.5 magnitudes deeper than single-exposure detections. Objects Table contains both point-like and extended objects. The survey covers ~25,000 square degrees of the northern hemisphere. This version of the catalog is in Apache Parquet format and partitioned following the Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme ([HATS](https://hats.readthedocs.io/)).'

  - Description: 'Lightcurves is a catalog of PSF-fit photometry detections extracted from single-exposure images at the locations of Objects Table detections. An object ID identifies related data in both catalogs. Photometry is in the native ZTF photometric system and the epoch-dependent zeropoints have already been applied. Note that Lightcurves detections may be missing, for example, in cases where the Objects Table detection is fainter or approximately equal to the single-exposure sensitivity limits. This version of the catalog is in Apache Parquet format and partitioned following the Hierarchical Adaptive Tiling Scheme ([HATS](https://hats.readthedocs.io/)).'
