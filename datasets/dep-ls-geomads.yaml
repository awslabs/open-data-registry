Name: Landsat Geometric Median and Absolute Deviations (GeoMAD) over the Pacific.
Description: |
  The GeoMAD is derived from Landsat surface reflectance data.
  The data are masked for cloud, shadows and other image artefacts
  using the associated pixel quality product to help provide as
  clear a set of observations as possible from which to calculate the medians.
