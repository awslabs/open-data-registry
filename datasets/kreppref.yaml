Name: Reference Indexes for krepp
Description: krepp is an alignment-free method for estimating distances and phylogenetic placement of individual reads to many thousands of reference genomes in aÂ scalable manner using k-mers. This dataset includes k-mer-based indexes consisting of ultra-large reference genome sets that can be efficiently analyzed using krepp.
