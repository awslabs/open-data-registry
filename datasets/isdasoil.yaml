    Title: iSDAsoil Python tutorial
    URL: https://github.com/iSDA-Africa/isdasoil-tutorial
Description: iSDAsoil is a resource containing soil property predictions for the entire
  African continent, generated using machine learning. Maps for over 20 different
  soil properties have been created at 2 different depths (0-20 and 20-50cm).  Soil
  property predictions were made using machine learning coupled with remote sensing
  data and a training set of over 100,000 analyzed soil samples. Included in this
  dataset are images of predicted soil properties, model error and satellite covariates
  used in the mapping process.
