Name: BUSCO Datasets
Description: Lineage datasets for use with BUSCO software package. Each dataset contains HMM profiles for clade specific, universal, single-copy marker genes. Datasets are available across archaea, bacteria, eukaryota and virus domains. The repository also includes necessary data files for phylogenetic placement of an input assembly.

ManagedBy: Computational Evolutionary Genomics Group, University of Geneva
UpdateFrequency: New datasets are released to correspond with updates in OrthoDB versions. Maintenance updates occur a few times a year if necessary to fix any bugs or update metadata.
