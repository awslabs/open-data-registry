Description: "This is a single-sensor multi-satellite  SSTfnd product for a single\
  \ 24 hour period, derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available\
  \ NOAA polar-orbiting satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical\
  \ equidistant projected map over the region 70\xB0E to 170\xB0W, 20\xB0N to 70\xB0\
  S.  Each grid cell contains the 24 hour average of all the highest available quality\
  \ SSTs that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram\
  \ at https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where\
  \ this product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is\
  \ derived by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting\
  \ observations with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see\
  \ http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf). Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations\
  \ indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.01 degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC.\
  \ Refer to the IMOS SST products web page at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html\
  \ and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html for further\
  \ information."
