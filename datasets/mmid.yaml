Description: 'MMID is a large-scale, massively multilingual dataset of images paired
  with the words they represent collected at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://upenn.edu).

  The dataset is doubly parallel: for each language, words are stored parallel to
  images that represent the word, _and_ parallel to the word''s translation into English
  (and corresponding images.)
