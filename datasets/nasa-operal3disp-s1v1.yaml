Name: OPERA Surface Displacement from Sentinel-1 validated product (Version 1)
Description: "The Level-3 OPERA Sentinel-1 Surface Displacement (DISP) product is
  generated through interferometric time-series analysis of Level-2 Coregistered Sentinel-1
  Single Look Complex (CSLC) datasets. Using a hybrid Persistent Scatterer (PS) and
  Distributed Scatterer (DS) approach, this product quantifies Earth's surface displacement
  in the radar line-of-sight. The DISP products enable the detection of anthropogenic
  and natural surface changes, including subsidence, tectonic deformation, and landslides.
  \n\nThe OPERA DISP suite comprises complementary datasets derived from Sentinel-1
  and NISAR inputs, designated as DISP-S1 and DISP-NI, respectively. Each product,
  created per acquisition, adheres to a consistent structure, HDF5 file format, file-naming
  convention, and a 30 m spatial posting. This collection specifically includes DISP-S1
  products, derived from Sentinel-1 data. \n\nDISP-S1 products provide spatial coverage
  across North America, encompassing the United States, U.S. territories within 200
  km of the U.S. border, Canada, and mainland countries from the southern U.S. border
  to Panama. These products are generated from Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide (IW)
  swath mode acquisitions starting in mid-2016. \n\nThe OPERA DISP-S1 product contains
  modified Copernicus Sentinel data (2016-2025).\nRead our doc on how to get AWS Credentials
