Name: GEOGloWS Hydrologic Model Version 2
Description: An 80+ year retrospective simulation of river discharge at 7 million river subunits worldwide. The simulation is reported as daily average discharge at each river in units of m^3/s. It is derived from the ERA5 reanalysis data, the TDX-Hydro streams and basins dataset, and Muskingum river routing.
