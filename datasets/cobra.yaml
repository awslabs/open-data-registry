Name: COBRA
Description: |
    This dataset contains the COBRA skin pathology dataset. This dataset comprises over 7000 medical images of histopathology whole-slide-images from basal cell carcinoma skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer. The dataset includes biopsies and excisions and is divided into four groups. The first group contains about 2,500 BCC biopsies with subtype labels, while the second group includes 2,500 non-BCC biopsies with different types of skin dysplasia. The third group has 1,000 labelled risky tumor biopsies, including rare and dangerous types like melanoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Finally, the fourth group contains 1,000 BCC excisions with or without free tumor margins, with 300 fully annotated. The dataset will be released over the year in stages, starting with the BCC and non-BCC biopsies, followed by BCC excisions, and finally the risky tumor biopsies.
