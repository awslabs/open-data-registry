Description: 'This page describes the COBRA (Classification Of Basal cell carcinoma,
  Risky skin cancers and Abnormalities) skin pathology dataset, which comprises over
  7000 histopathology whole-slide-images related to the diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma
  skin cancer, the most commonly diagnosed cancer. The dataset includes biopsies and
  excisions and is divided into four groups. The first group contains about 2,500
  BCC biopsies with subtype labels, while the second group includes 2,500 non-BCC
  biopsies with different types of skin dysplasia. The third group has 1,000 labelled
  risky cancer biopsies, including rare and dangerous types like melanoma, squamous
  cell carcinoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma. Finally, the fourth group contains 1,000
  BCC excisions with or without free tumor margins, with 300 fully annotated. The
  dataset will be released over 2023 in stages, starting with the BCC and non-BCC
  biopsies, followed by BCC excisions, and finally the risky cancer biopsies.
