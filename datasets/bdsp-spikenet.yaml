Name: SpikeNet 2.0
Version: 1.0
Description: SpikeNet2 is an advanced deep learning model for automated detection of epileptiform discharges in EEG recordings. Trained on over 17,000 EEGs and validated across multiple external datasets, it achieves expert-level performance in both event-level and EEG-level classification with reduced false positives.
