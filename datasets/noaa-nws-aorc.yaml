  Description: "The Analysis Of Record for Calibration (AORC) is a gridded record\
    \ of near-surface  weather conditions covering the continental United States and\
    \ Alaska and their  hydrologically contributing areas. It is defined on a latitude/longitude\
    \ spatial grid with a mesh length of 30 arc seconds (~800 m), and a temporal resolution\
    \ of one hour.  Elements include hourly total precipitation, temperature, specific\
    \ humidity, terrain-level  pressure, downward longwave and shortwave radiation,\
    \ and west-east and south-north wind components. It spans the period from 1979\
    \ across the Continental U.S. (CONUS) and from 1981 across Alaska, to the near-present\
    \ (at all locations). This suite of eight variables is sufficient to drive most\
    \ land-surface and hydrologic models and is used as input to the National Water\
    \ Model (NWM) retrospective simulation. While the native AORC process generates\
    \ netCDF output, the data is post-processed to create a cloud optimized Zarr formatted\
    \ equivalent for dissemination using cloud technology and infrastructure.\n<br/>\n\
    <br/>\n**AORC Version 1.1 dataset creation**\n<br/>\nThe AORC dataset was created\
    \ after reviewing, identifying, and processing multiple large-scale, observation,\
    \ and analysis datasets. There are two versions of The Analysis Of Record for\
    \ Calibration (AORC) data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe initial AORC Version 1.0 dataset\
    \ was completed in November 2019 and consisted of a grid with 8 elements at a\
    \ resolution of 30 arc seconds.  The AORC version 1.1 dataset was created to address\
    \ issues \"[see Table 1 in Fall et al., 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13143)\"\
    \ in the version 1.0 CONUS dataset. Full documentation on version 1.1 of the AORC\
    \ data and the related journal publication are provided below.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
    The native AORC version 1.1 process creates a dataset that consists of netCDF\
    \ files with the following dimensions: 1 hour, 4201 latitude values (ranging from\
    \ 25.0 to 53.0), and 8401 longitude values (ranging from -125.0 to -67).\n<br/>\n\
    <br/>\nThe data creation runs with a 10-day lag to ensure the inclusion of any\
    \ corrections to the input Stage IV and NLDAS data.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Note** -\
    \ The full extent of the AORC grid as defined in its data files exceed those cited\
    \ above; those outermost rows and columns of data grids are filled with missing\
    \ values and are the remnant of an early set of required AORC extents that have\
    \ since been adjusted inward.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**AORC Version 1.1 Zarr Conversion**\n\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe goal for converting the AORC data from netCDF to Zarr was to\
    \ allow users to quickly and efficiently load/use the data.  For example, one\
    \ year of data takes 28 mins to load via NetCDF while only taking 3.2 seconds\
    \ to load via Zarr (resulting in a substantial increase in speed).  For longer\
    \ periods of time, the percentage increase in speed using Zarr (vs NetCDF) is\
    \ even higher.  Using Zarr also leads to less memory and CPU utilization.\n<br/>\n\
    <br/>\nIt was determined that the optimal conversion for the data was 1 year worth\
    \ of Zarr files with a chunk size of 18MB. The chunking was completed across all\
    \ 8 variables.  The chunks consist of the following dimensions: 144 time, 128\
    \ latitude, and 256 longitude. To create the files in the Zarr format, the NetCDF\
    \ files were rechunked using chunk() and \"[Xarray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/)\"\
    .  After chunking the files, they were converted to a monthly Zarr file. Then,\
    \ each monthly Zarr file was combined using \"[to_zarr](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.Dataset.to_zarr.html)\"\
    \ to create a Zarr file that represents a full year\n<br/>\n<br/>\nUsers wanting\
    \ more than 1 year of data will be able to utilize Zarr utilities/libraries to\
    \ combine multiple years up to the span of the full data set.\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\
    There are eight variables representing the meteorological conditions\n<br/>\n\
    **Total Precipitaion (APCP_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) Hourly total precipitation (kgm-2\
    \ or mm)  for Calibration (AORC) dataset\n<br/>\n**Air Temperature (TMP_2maboveground)**\n\
    1) Temperature (at 2 m above-ground-level (AGL)) (K)\n<br/>\n**Specific Humidity\
    \ (SPFH_2maboveground)**\n<br/>\n1) Specific humidity (at 2 m AGL) (g g-1) \n\
    <br/>\n**Downward Long-Wave Radiation Flux (DLWRF_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) longwave\
    \ (infrared)\n2) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2) \n<br/>\n**Downward\
    \ Short-Wave Radiation Flux (DSWRF_surface)**\n<br/>\n1) Downward shortwave (solar)\n\
    2) radiation flux (at the  surface) (W m-2)\n<br/>\n**Pressure (PRES_surface)**\n\
    <br/>\n1) Air pressure (at the surface) (Pa)\n<br/>\n**U-Component of Wind (UGRD_10maboveground)\"\
    \n<br/>\n1)U (west-east) - components of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1)\n<br/>\n\
    **V-Component of Wind (VGRD_10maboveground)\"\n<br/>\n1) V (south-north) - components\
    \ of the wind (at 10 m AGL) (m s-1)\n<br/>\n<br/>\n**Precipitation and Temperature**\n\
    <br/>\n<br/>\nThe gridded AORC precipitation dataset contains one-hour Accumulated\
    \ Surface Precipitation (APCP) ending at the \u201Ctop\u201D of each hour, in\
    \ liquid water-equivalent units  (kg m-2 to the nearest 0.1 kg m-2), while the\
    \ gridded AORC temperature dataset is comprised of instantaneous, 2 m above-ground-level\
    \ (AGL) temperatures at the top of each hour (in Kelvin, to the nearest 0.1).\n\
    <br/>\n<br/>\n**Specific Humidity, Pressure, Downward Radiation, Wind**\n<br/>\n\
    <br/>\nThe development process for the six additional dataset components of the\
    \ Conus AORC [i.e., specific humidity at 2m above ground (kg kg-1); downward \
    \ longwave and shortwave radiation fluxes at the surface (W m-2); terrain-level\
    \ pressure (Pa); and west-east and south-north wind components at 10 m above ground\
    \ (m s-1)] has  two distinct periods, based on datasets and methodology applied:\
    \ 1979\u20132015 and 2016\u2013present. \n", Documentation: '[Analysis of Record
