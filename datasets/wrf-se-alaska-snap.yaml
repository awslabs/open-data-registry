Name: High Resolution Downscaled Climate Data for Southeast Alaska
Description: "This dataset contains historical and projected dynamically downscaled climate data for the Southeast region of the State of Alaska at 1 and 4km spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution. Select variables are also summarized into daily resolutions. This data was produced using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Version 4.0). We downscaled both Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) historical reanalysis data (1980-2019) and both historical and projected runs from two GCMâ€™s from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5): GFDL-CM3 and NCAR-CCSM4 (historical run: 1980-2010 and RCP 8.5: 2030-2060)."
