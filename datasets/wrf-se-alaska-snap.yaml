Description: "This dataset contains historical and projected dynamically downscaled\
  \ climate data for the Southeast region of the State of Alaska at 1 and 4km spatial\
  \ resolution and hourly temporal resolution. Select variables are also summarized\
  \ into daily resolutions. This data was produced using the Weather Research and\
  \ Forecasting (WRF) model (Version 4.0). We downscaled both Climate Forecast System\
  \ Reanalysis (CFSR) historical reanalysis data (1980-2019) and both historical and\
  \ projected runs from two GCM\u2019s from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project\
  \ 5 (CMIP5): GFDL-CM3 and NCAR-CCSM4 (historical run: 1980-2010 and RCP 8.5: 2030-2060)."
