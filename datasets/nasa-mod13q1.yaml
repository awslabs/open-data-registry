Name: MODIS/Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global 250m SIN Grid V061
Description: "The Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation
  Indices (MOD13Q1) Version 6.1 data are generated every 16 days at 250 meter (m)
  spatial resolution as a Level 3 product. The MOD13Q1 product provides two primary
  vegetation layers. The first is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
  which is referred to as the continuity index to the existing National Oceanic and
  Atmospheric Administration-Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR)
  derived NDVI. The second vegetation layer is the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),
  which has improved sensitivity over high biomass regions. The algorithm chooses
  the best available pixel value from all the acquisitions from the 16 day period.
  The criteria used is low clouds, low view angle, and the highest NDVI/EVI value.\n\nAlong
  with the vegetation layers and the two quality layers, the HDF file will have MODIS
  reflectance bands 1 (red), 2 (near-infrared), 3 (blue), and 7 (mid-infrared), as
  well as four observation layers. \n\nKnown Issues\n* For complete information about
  known issues please refer to the [MODIS/VIIRS Land Quality Assessment website](https://landweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/knownissue?sensor=MODIS&sat=Terra&as=61).\n\nImprovements/Changes
  from Previous Versions\n* The Version 6.1 Level-1B (L1B) products have been improved
  by undergoing various calibration changes that include: changes to the response-versus-scan
  angle (RVS) approach that affects reflectance bands for Aqua and Terra MODIS, corrections
  to adjust for the optical crosstalk in Terra MODIS infrared (IR) bands, and corrections
  to the Terra MODIS forward look-up table (LUT) update for the period 2012 - 2017.\n*
  A polarization correction has been applied to the L1B Reflective Solar Bands (RSB).\nRead
