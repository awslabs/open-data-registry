Description: 'The REaltime DAta Synthesis and Analysis (REDASA) COVID-19 snapshot
  contains the output of the curation protocol produced by our curator community.
  A detailed description can be found in [our paper](https://www.jmir.org/2021/5/e25714).
  The first S3 bucket listed in Resources contains a large collection of medical documents
  in text format extracted from the [CORD-19 dataset](https://registry.opendata.aws/cord-19/),
  plus other sources deemed relevant by the REDASA consortium.  The second S3 bucket
  contains a series of documents surfaced by [Amazon Kendra](https://aws.amazon.com/kendra/)
  that were considered relevant for each medical question asked. The final S3 bucket
  contains the GroundTruth annotations created by our curator community.
