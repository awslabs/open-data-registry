  OAQPS 2022 Modeling Platform 
Description: >-
  The data are part of the 2022 Modeling Platform used to support regulatory actions
  and technical analyses conducted by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and
  Standards. Specifically, this data is Weather Research and Forecasting Model (v4.4.2)
  conducted at a 12-km resolution over the Continental United States (12US). Additionally,
  MCIP-processed files are also available as part of this dataset to asset in the use of
  emissions processing and photochemical modeling. These files may be used in downstream 
  applications to generate emissions, photochemical modeling, or dispersion modeling inputs.

      The 2022 WRF output are stored as uncompressed netcdf/hdf5 formatted files in 
      the /WRF directory. The 2022 MCIP output are stored as uncompressed netcdf/hdf5 
      formatted files in IOAPI format in the /MCIP directory. Information on the model 
      projection and grid structure is contained in the header information of the 
      netcdf file. The netcdf files can be opened and manipulated using software programs 
      that can read and write netcdf formatted files (e.g. Fortran, R, Python).
      The WRF files are daily files containing hourly data beginning at 00UTC through
      23UTC for each modeled day. For more information: https://www2.mmm.ucar.edu/wrf/users/
      The MCIP files are daily files with multiple files for each day. For more information
      about what each MCIP file contains, please see the following GitHub entry:
