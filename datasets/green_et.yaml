Name: IWMI DIWASA Green ET for Africa
Description: Green evapotranspiration (Green ET) is the portion of ET derived from green water, which includes soil moisture and rainfall used by vegetation. It represents a key component of green water fluxes in water accounting. Green ET consists of evaporation from soil moisture in non-irrigated areas, transpiration from rainfed crops and natural vegetation, and interception losses from precipitation on vegetation. It plays a crucial role in rainfed agriculture, drought monitoring, and sustainable water management by tracking how rainfall supports plant growth.
