Description: The Multimedia Commons is a collection of audio and visual features computed
  for the nearly 100 million Creative Commons-licensed Flickr images and videos in
  the YFCC100M dataset from Yahoo! Labs, along with ground-truth annotations for selected
  subsets. The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and Lawrence Livermore
  National Laboratory are producing and distributing a core set of derived feature
  sets and annotations as part of an effort to enable large-scale video search capabilities.
  They have released this feature corpus into the public domain, under Creative Commons
  License 0, so it is free for anyone to use for any purpose.
