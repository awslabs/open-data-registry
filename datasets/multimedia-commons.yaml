Name: Multimedia Commons
Description: The Multimedia Commons is a collection of audio and visual features computed for the nearly 100 million Creative Commons-licensed Flickr images and videos in the YFCC100M dataset from Yahoo! Labs, along with ground-truth annotations for selected subsets. The International Computer Science Institute (ICSI) and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory are producing and distributing a core set of derived feature sets and annotations as part of an effort to enable large-scale video search capabilities. They have released this feature corpus into the public domain, under Creative Commons License 0, so it is free for anyone to use for any purpose.
