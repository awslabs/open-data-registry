Description: 'The aim of this project is to create an easy-to-use platform where various
  types of analytics can be performed on a wide range of electrical grid datasets.
  The aim is to establish an open-source library of algorithms that universities,
  national labs and other developers can contribute to which can be used on both open-source
  and proprietary grid data to improve the analysis of electrical distribution systems
  for the grid modeling community. OEDI Systems Integration (SI) is a grid algorithms
  and data analytics API created to standardize how data is sent between different
  modules that are run as part of a co-simulation.
