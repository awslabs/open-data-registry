Name: Ocean Radar - Coral coast site - Sea water velocity - Delayed mode
Description: 'The Coral Coast (CORL) HF ocean radar system covers an area of the Western
  Australia Coast, Western Australia, an area subject to the variability of the Leeuwin
  Current (LC) and its coupling with coastal winds, tides, and waves. In this area
  the LC generates several eddies which control the larval species and the higher
  marine species and ecosystems in which they forage.


  The CORL HF ocean radar system consists of two SeaSonde crossed loop direction finding
  stations located at Dongara (29.283 S 114.920E) and Green Head (114.967 E 30.073
  S).  These radars operate at a frequency of 4.463 MHz, with a bandwidth of 25 KHz,
  a maximum range of 200 Km and a range resolution of 6 Km.  Within the HF radar coverage
  area surface currents are measured.


  The CORL area of coverage has a small overlap of commonly observed ocean with the
  Turqoise Coast (TURQ) SeaSonde HF ocean radar system on its southern side, which
  in turns early overlaps with the Rottnest HF radar node.  Together, the CORL, TURQ
  and ROT systems provide continuous monitoring of the shelf from Fremantle to Geraldton.'
