Name: OpenRoboCare Multi-Modal Expert Demonstration Dataset for Robot-Assisted Caregiving
Description: A comprehensive multimodal dataset capturing real-world caregiving routines from 21 occupational therapists performing 15 daily caregiving tasks. The dataset includes synchronized RGB-D video, tactile sensing, eye-gaze tracking, pose annotations, and action labels across 315 sessions totaling 19.8 hours of expert demonstrations. Data modalities include anonymized RGB images, depth maps, 44-sensor tactile readings, 2D/3D pose tracking, temporal action annotations, and first/third-person videos, enabling research in robot learning from demonstration, multimodal perception, and safe human-robot interaction for caregiving applications.
