    Title: 'ssj_latbin: Create and read ML-ready DMSP particle precipitation data'
    URL: https://github.com/lkilcommons/ssj_latbin
Description: The United States Air Force (USAF) Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
  (DMSP) SSJ precipitating particle instrument measures in-situ total flux and energy
  distribution of electrons and ions at low earth orbit. These precipitating particles
  are of interest for space weather operations and research, in part because they
  produce aurora during normal and very strong geomagnetic storms. This dataset contains
  both sensor-level raw data (as detailed in Redmon et al. 2017) and a high-level
  machine-learning-ready data product.
