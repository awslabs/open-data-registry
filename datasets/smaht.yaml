Name: Somatic Mosaicism across Humnan Tissues (SMaHT)
Description: | 
  The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) project is an NIH Common Fund consortium (2023-)
  aimed to comprehensively characterize somatic variation (“mosaicism”) in normal human tissues. While
  most genetic studies have relied on blood-derived DNA, SMaHT captures the full spectrum of DNA variation
  across cell types, tissues, and organs from phenotypically normal individuals to better understand the 
  role of somatic mosaicism in human development, aging, and disease progression. In addition to generating
  production data across ~20 tissue types from 150 post-mortem donors, SMaHT also produces datasets from 
  cell line and tissue homogenate samples, to benchmark and develop new technologies and computational tools
  for mosaic variant detection. The resulting data include high-coverage whole-genome and transcriptome data
  using both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies from multiple platforms. SMaHT will also 
  generate comprehensive genome-wide catalogs of somatic variants.

Citation: The SMaHT datasets were generated as part of the NIH Common Fund consortium initiative,
  Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT). The SMaHT datasets are submitted under dbGaP 
  studies (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), with the study accession numbers, phs004193 for the
  SMaHT Benchmarking data and phs004194 for the SMaHT Production data. The datasets were provided 
  by the SMaHT Data Analysis Center (DAC) [1UM1DA058230] on behalf of the SMaHT network. More 
  information about the SMaHT Network is available online at https://smaht.org/, about the SMaHT 
  Data Portal at https://data.smaht.org/ , and types of data generated by the Network at
