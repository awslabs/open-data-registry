Name: Somatic Mosaicism across Humnan Tissues (SMaHT)
Description: | 
  The Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT) project is an NIH Common
  Fund consortium (2023-) aimed to comprehensively characterize somatic variation
  ("mosaicism") in normal human tissues. While most genetic studies have relied
  on blood-derived DNA, SMaHT captures the full spectrum of DNA variation across
  cell types, tissues, and organs from phenotypically normal individuals to
  better understand the role of somatic mosaicism in human development, aging,
  and disease progression.

  Researchers in the consortium develop and apply experimental and computational
  methods, paired with the state-of-the-art sequencing technologies, to accurately
  detect even rare mutations (frequency < 1%) in subpopulations of cells. In
  addition to generating the production data across ~20 tissue types from 150
  post-mortem donors, SMaHT also produces datasets from cell line and tissue
  homogenate samples, to benchmark and develop new technologies and computational
  tools for mosaic variant detection.

  The resulting data include high-coverage whole-genome and transcriptome data
  using both short-read and long-read sequencing technologies from multiple platforms
  (e.g., Illumina, PacBio, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Ultima Genomics). SMaHT will
  also generate comprehensive genome-wide catalogs of somatic variants. We anticipate
  that this resource will be valuable not only for researchers studying somatic
  mosaicism, but also for the broader scientific community interested in large-scale
  WGS data from normal human tissues. More about the SMaHT project:

Citation: The SMaHT datasets were generated as part of the NIH Common Fund consortium initiative,
  Somatic Mosaicism across Human Tissues (SMaHT). The SMaHT datasets are submitted under dbGaP 
  studies (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap), with the study accession numbers, phs004193 for the
  SMaHT Benchmarking data and phs004194 for the SMaHT Production data. The datasets were provided 
  by the SMaHT Data Analysis Center (DAC) [1UM1DA058230] on behalf of the SMaHT network. More 
  information about the SMaHT Network is available online at https://smaht.org/, about the SMaHT

  - Description: |
      SMaHT Open-Access Data - Publicly available data files without restriction, including
      aligned reads from WGS and RNA-Seq, as well as variants identified from cell line
      samples that are commercially available without restriction. Somatic (non-inherited)
      variants from donor tissue samples are also open-access data.
