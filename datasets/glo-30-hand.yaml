Name: Global 30m Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND)
Description: >
  Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) is a terrain model that normalizes topography to the relative heights along the
  drainage network and is used to describe the relative soil gravitational potentials or the local drainage potentials.
  Each pixel value represents the vertical distance to the nearest drainage. The HAND data provides near-worldwide land
  coverage at 30 meters and was produced from the 2021 release of the Copernicus GLO-30 Public DEM as distributed in the
  [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/copernicus-dem/).

  None, except HAND may be updated if the[ Copernicus GLO-30 Public](https://registry.opendata.aws/copernicus-dem/)
  dataset is updated.
