Description: "NASA's goal in Earth science is to observe, understand, and model the\
  \ Earth system to discover how it is changing, to better predict change, and to\
  \ understand the consequences for life on Earth. The Applied Sciences Program serves\
  \ NASA and Society by expanding and accelerating the realization of societal and\
  \ economic benefits from Earth science, information, and technology research and\
  \ development. <br/><br/>\nThe NASA [Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER)](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/)\
  \ Project, a NASA Applied Sciences program, improves the accessibility and usage\
  \ NASA Earth Observations (EO) supporting community research in three focus areas:\
  \ 1) renewable energy development, 2) building energy efficiency, and 3) agroclimatology\
  \ applications. POWER can help communities be resilient amid observed climate variability\
  \ through the easy access of solar and meteorological data via a verity of access\
  \ methods. <br/><br/>\nThe latest POWER version includes hourly-based source Analysis\
  \ Ready Data (ARD), in addition to enhanced daily, monthly, annual, and climatology\
  \ ARD. The daily time-series spans 40 years for meteorology available from 1981\
  \ and solar-based parameters start in 1984. The hourly source data are from Clouds\
  \ and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and Global Modeling and Assimilation\
  \ Office (GMAO), spanning 20 years from 2001. The hourly data will provide users\
  \ the ARD needed to model the energy performance of building systems, providing\
  \ information directly amenable to decision support tools introducing the industry\
  \ standard EPW (EnergyPlus Weather file). <br/><br/> \nPOWER also provides parameters\
  \ at daily, monthly, annual, and user-defined time periods, spanning from 1984 through\
  \ to within a week of real time. Additionally, POWER provides are user-defined analytic\
  \ capabilities, including custom climatologies and climatological-based reports\
  \ for parameter anomalies, ASHRAE\xAE compatible climate design condition statistics,\
  \ and building climate zones. <br/><br/>\nThe ARD and climate analytics will be\
  \ readily accessible through POWER's integrated services suite, including the [Data\
  \ Access Viewer (DAV)](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/). The DAV\
  \ has recently been improved to incorporate updated parameter groupings, new analytical\
  \ capabilities, and the new data formats.  POWER also provides a complete [API (Application\
  \ Programming Interface)](https://power.larc.nasa.gov/api/pages/) that allows uses\
  \ to obtain all the parameters in the DAV plus additional parameters for larger\
  \ repetitive orders or from within the user\\'s own analytic tools. <br/><br/>\n"
