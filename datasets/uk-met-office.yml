Name: UK Met Office Atmospheric Deterministic and Probabilistic Forecasts
Description: |
  Meteorological data reusers now have an exciting opportunity to sample, experiment and evaluate
  Met Office atmospheric model data, whilst also experiencing a transformative method of requesting
  data via Restful APIs on AWS. All ahead of Met Office’s own operationally supported API platform
  that will be launched in late 2019.
