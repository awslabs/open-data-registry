Description: "DE-SynPUF is provided here as a 1,000 person (1k), 100,000 person (100k),\
  \ and 2,300,000 persom (2.3m) data sets in the [OMOP Common Data Model](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/)\
  \ format.  The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set\
  \ of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of\
  \ protection to the Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 protected health information. \
  \ The purposes of the DE-SynPUF are to: \n1. allow data entrepreneurs to develop\
  \ and create software and applications that may eventually be applied to actual\
  \ CMS claims data;\n2. train researchers on the use and complexity of conducting\
  \ analyses with CMS claims data prior to initiating the process to obtain access\
  \ to actual CMS data; and,\n3. support safe data mining innovations that may reveal\
  \ unanticipated knowledge gains while preserving beneficiary privacy.\nThe files\
  \ have been designed so that programs and procedures created on the DE-SynPUF will\
  \ function on CMS Limited Data Sets. The data structure of the Medicare DE-SynPUF\
  \ is very similar to the CMS Limited Data Sets, but with a smaller number of variables.\
  \  The DE-SynPUF also provides a robust set of metadata on the CMS claims data that\
  \ have not been previously available in the public domain.  Although the DE-SynPUF\
  \ has very limited inferential research value to draw conclusions about Medicare\
  \ beneficiaries due to the synthetic processes used to create the file, the Medicare\
  \ DE-SynPUF does increase access to a realistic Medicare claims data file in a timely\
  \ and less expensive manner to spur the innovation necessary to achieve the goals\
  \ of better care for beneficiaries and improve the health of the population.\n"
