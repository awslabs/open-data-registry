Description: "Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) have moorings across both\
  \ it's National Mooring Network and Deep Water Moorings facilities. The National\
  \ Mooring Network facility comprises a series of national reference stations and\
  \ regional moorings designed to monitor particular oceanographic phenomena in Australian\
  \ coastal ocean waters. The Deep Water Moorings facility (formerly known as the\
  \ Australian Bluewater Observing System) provides the coordination of national efforts\
  \ in the sustained observation of open ocean properties with particular emphasis\
  \ on observations important to climate and carbon cycle studies, with selected moorings\
  \ from its Deep Water Arrays sub-facility providing data to this collection.\nThis\
  \ collection represents the hourly aggregated time-series product, which combines\
  \ selected variables measured by all the instruments deployed at a site, binning\
  \ the values into a fixed one-hour interval. Only good-quality measurements (according\
  \ to the automated quality-control procedures applied by the National Mooring Network)\
  \ are included. \nThe parameters are: temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll\
  \ estimates, turbidity, down-welling photosynthetic photon flux (PAR), and current\
  \ velocity, accompanied by depth and pressure when available. The observations were\
  \ made using a range of temperature loggers, conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD)\
  \ instruments, water-quality monitors (WQM), acoustic Doppler current profilers\
  \ (ADCPs), and single-point current meters."
