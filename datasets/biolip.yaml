Name: BioLiP
Description: BioLiP is a semi-manually curated database for high-quality, biologically relevant ligand-protein binding interactions. The structure data are collected primarily from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with biological insights mined from literature and other specific databases. BioLiP aims to construct the most comprehensive and accurate database for serving the needs of ligand-protein docking, virtual ligand screening and protein function annotation.
