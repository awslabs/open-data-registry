Description: 'The US National Center for Atmospheric Research partnered with the IBS
  Center for Climate Physics in South Korea to generate the CESM2 Large Ensemble which
  consists of 100 ensemble members at 1 degree spatial resolution covering the period
  1850-2100 under CMIP6 historical and SSP370 future radiative forcing scenarios.
  Data sets from this ensemble were made downloadable via the Climate Data Gateway
  on June 14th, 2021.

  NCAR has copied a subset (currently ~500 TB) of CESM2 LENS data to Amazon S3 as
  part of the AWS Public Datasets Program. To optimize for large-scale analytics we
  have represented the data as ~275 Zarr stores format accessible through the Python
  Xarray library. Each Zarr store contains a single physical variable for a given
  model run type and temporal frequency (monthly, daily).

UpdateFrequency: Rare. The LENS experiment is complete, but we may occasionally copy
  additional fields from NCAR to AWS, or fix problems discovered in the AWS copy.
