Name: CHIMERA
Description: This dataset contains the training data for the [CHIMERA - Combining HIstology, Medical imaging (radiology) and molEcular data for medical pRognosis and diAgnosis](https://chimera.grand-challenge.org/) challenge. The CHIMERA Challenge aims to advance precision medicine in cancer care by addressing the critical need for multimodal data integration. Despite significant progress in AI, integrating transcriptomics, pathology, and radiology across clinical departments remains a complex challenge. Clinicians are faced with large, heterogeneous datasets that are difficult to analyze effectively. AI has the potential to unify multimodal data, but several technical barriers remain, such as defining appropriate fusion stages and handling missing modalities.
