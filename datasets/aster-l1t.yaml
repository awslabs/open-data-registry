Description: "The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)\
  \ Level 1\nPrecision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) data\
  \ contains\ncalibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level\
  \ 1B (AST_L1B),\nthat has been geometrically corrected, and rotated to a north-up\
  \ UTM projection.\nThe AST_L1T is created from a single resampling of the corresponding\
  \ ASTER L1A (AST_L1A) product.\n\nThe precision terrain correction process incorporates\
  \ GLS2000 digital elevation data with\nderived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve\
  \ topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes\nwhere correlation statistics reach\
  \ a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are\npossible (systematic\
  \ terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that\notherwise\
  \ represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).\n\nEach AST_L1T\
  \ granule is converted into three different COG files based on the sensor and spatial\
  \ resolution,\nVNIR at 15m, SWIR at 30m and TIR at 90m. The metadata required to\
  \ transform the digital numbers (DN) to \nradiance and reflectance values are also\
  \ incorporated as metadata in the TIFF files.\nThe filenaming convention and the\
  \ organization of bands are described\n[here](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-docs/tree/main/docs/aster-l1t).\n"
