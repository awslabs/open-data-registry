Name: ASTER L1T Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs
Description: |
  The Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Level 1
  Precision Terrain Corrected Registered At-Sensor Radiance (AST_L1T) data contains
  calibrated at-sensor radiance, which corresponds with the ASTER Level 1B (AST_L1B),
  that has been geometrically corrected, and rotated to a north-up UTM projection.
  The AST_L1T is created from a single resampling of the corresponding ASTER L1A (AST_L1A) product.

  The precision terrain correction process incorporates GLS2000 digital elevation data with
  derived ground control points (GCPs) to achieve topographic accuracy for all daytime scenes
  where correlation statistics reach a minimum threshold. Alternate levels of correction are
  possible (systematic terrain, systematic, or precision) for scenes acquired at night or that
  otherwise represent a reduced quality ground image (e.g., cloud cover).

  Each AST_L1T granule is converted into three different COG files based on the sensor and spatial resolution,
  VNIR at 15m, SWIR at 30m and TIR at 90m. The metadata required to transform the digital numbers (DN) to 
  radiance and reflectance values are also incorporated as metadata in the TIFF files.
  The filenaming convention and the organization of bands are described
  [here](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-docs/tree/main/docs/aster-l1t).
