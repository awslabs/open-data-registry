Name: Genome Ark
Description: The Genome Ark hosts genomic information for the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP) and other related projects. The VGP is an international collaboration that aims to generate complete and near error-free reference genomes for all extant vertebrate species. These genomes will be used to address fundamental questions in biology and disease, to identify species most genetically at risk for extinction, and to preserve genetic information of life.
