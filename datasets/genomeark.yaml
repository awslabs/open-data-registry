Description: The Genome Ark hosts genomic information for the Vertebrate Genomes Project
  (VGP) and other related projects. The VGP is an international collaboration that
  aims to generate complete and near error-free reference genomes for all extant vertebrate
  species. These genomes will be used to address fundamental questions in biology
  and disease, to identify species most genetically at risk for extinction, and to
  preserve genetic information of life.
