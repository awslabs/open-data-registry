Name: SILO climate data on AWS
Description: |
  [SILO](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo) is a database of Australian [climate data](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/about/climate-variables) from 1889 to the present. It provides continuous, daily time-step [data products](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/about/data-products) in ready-to-use [formats](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/about/file-formats-and-samples) for research and operational applications.
  SILO's gridded datasets (in NetCDF and GeoTiff formats) are hosted on AWS Public Data. Point data (at both station and grid cell locations) are available from the [SILO website](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/). Incremental update files for mirroring point datasets at station locations are also available on AWS Public Data.
