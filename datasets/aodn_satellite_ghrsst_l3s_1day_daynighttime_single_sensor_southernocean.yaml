Name: Satellite - Sea surface temperature - Level 3 - Single sensor - 1 day - Day
  and night time - Southern Ocean
Description: "This is a single-sensor SSTfnd product for a single 24 hour period,\
  \ derived using observations from AVHRR instruments on all available NOAA polar-orbiting\
  \ satellites.  It is provided as a 0.02deg x 0.02deg cylindrical equidistant projected\
  \ map over the Southern Ocean region 3\xB0E to 158\xB0W, 27\xB0S to 78\xB0S.  Each\
  \ grid cell contains the 24 hour average of all the highest available quality SSTs\
  \ that overlap with that cell, weighted by the area of overlap.  The diagram at\
  \ https://help.aodn.org.au/satellite-data-product-information/ indicates where this\
  \ product fits within the GHRSST suite of NOAA/AVHRR products. The SSTfnd is derived\
  \ by adding a constant 0.17 degC to the SSTskin observations after rejecting observations\
  \ with low surface wind speeds (<6m/s by day and <2m/s at night) (see http://www.bom.gov.au/amoj/docs/2011/beggs.pdf).\
  \ Matchups with buoy SSTfnd observations indicate typical 2014 biases of < 0.01\
  \ degC and standard deviations of 0.6 degC. Refer to the IMOS SST products web page\
  \ at http://imos.org.au/sstproducts.html and Beggs et al. (2013) at http://imos.org.au/sstdata_references.html\
  \ for further information."
