Description: "This dataset contains historical and projected dynamically downscaled\
  \ climate data for the State of Alaska and surrounding regions at 20km spatial resolution\
  \ and hourly temporal resolution. Select variables are also summarized into daily\
  \ resolutions. This data was produced using the Weather Research and Forecasting\
  \ (WRF) model (Version 3.5). We downscaled both ERA-Interim historical reanalysis\
  \ data (1979-2015) and both historical and projected runs from 2 GCM\u2019s from\
  \ the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5): GFDL-CM3 and NCAR-CCSM4\
  \ (historical run: 1970-2005 and RCP 8.5: 2006-2100)."
