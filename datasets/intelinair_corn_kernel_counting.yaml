  Description: "Folder contains the terms of use, paper, and zip file of data in COOC\
    \ format. Each kernel is annotated with an instance mask and appropriate class.\
    \ The dataset is broken into three subcomponents.  The \"base\" (i.e. \"corn\"\
    ) subset contains images from a wide variety of domains such as those you might\
    \ find on the internet.  The \"narrow\" subset contains images with a single ear\
    \ as would be anticipated in the application.  The \"many\" dataset resembles\
    \ the base dataset but has a huge number of ears and kernels in each image. Images\
    \ were annotated for (healthy) kernels, diseased kernels, \u201Cincomplete\u201D\
    \ (i.e. not fully matured) kernels, barren tips (i.e where the top of the ear\
    \ does not produce kernels), and \u201Ckernel areas\u201D where on-ear kernels\
    \ were166present but resolution/lighting prevented annotation. \n"
