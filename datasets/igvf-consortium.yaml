Name: The Impact of Variation on Function Consortium (IGVF)
Description: |
  The IGVF (Impact of Genomic Variation on Function) Consortium aims to understand how genomic variation affects genome function, 
  which in turn impacts phenotype. The NHGRI is funding this collaborative program that brings together teams of investigators who 
  will use state-of-the-art experimental and computational approaches to model, predict, characterize and map genome function, how 
  genome function shapes phenotype, and how these processes are affected by genomic variation. These joint efforts will produce a 
  catalog of the impact of genomic variants on genome function and phenotypes.  
  The Data Corpus consists of single-cell Genomics experiments (both single modal, and multimodal, typically snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq), 
  Characterization experiments using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and CRISPR-screens along with a variety of protein mutatation 
  assays, and Predictive Models.
  There are a huge variety of files in IGVF that are stored in the AWS OpenData Set so we recommend using the [metadata file]() or browsing the [IGVF Data Portal](https://data.igvf.org)
