Name: Cloud Indexes for Bowtie, Kraken, HISAT, and Centrifuge
Description: Genomic tools use reference databases as indexes to operate quickly and efficiently, analogous to how web search engines use indexes for fast querying. Here, we aggregate genomic, pan-genomic and metagenomic indexes for analysis of sequencing data.
