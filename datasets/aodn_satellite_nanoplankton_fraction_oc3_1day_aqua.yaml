Name: Satellite - Ocean Colour - MODIS - 1 day - Nanoplankton fraction (OC3 model
  and Brewin et al 2012 algorithm)
Description: "The Aqua satellite platform carries a MODIS sensor that observes sunlight\
  \ reflected from within the ocean surface layer at multiple wavelengths. These multi-spectral\
  \ measurements are used to infer the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), most\
  \ typically due to phytoplankton, present in the water. An empirical relationship\
  \ is then used to compute an estimate of the relative abundance of three phytoplankton\
  \ size classes (micro, nano and picoplankton). \n\nThe methods used to decompose\
  \ chl_oc3 are described by Brewin et al in two papers in 2010 and 2012. The two\
  \ methods, denoted Brewin2010at and Brewin2012in, used calibration data from the\
  \ Atlantic and Indian Oceans respectively.  Users should note that these are unvalidated\
  \ experimental products and they should familiarise themselves with the underlying\
  \ algorithms and methodologies described in the published literature before making\
  \ use of them.\n\nThe data are produced from the same data stream as the MODIS Chla_oc3\
  \ data set (https://catalogue-imos.aodn.org.au:443/geonetwork/srv/api/records/d7a14921-8f3f-4522-9a54-e7d1df969c8a).\
  \ \n\nData are provided as two files per day, one with the percentage of nanoplankton,\
  \ and one for picoplankton. The percentage of microplankton is computed as the balance\
  \ to 100%, that is %micro = 100 - %nano - %pico."
