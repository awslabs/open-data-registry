Name: ARPA-E PERFORM Forecast data
Description: |
  The ARPA-E PERFORM Program is an ARPA-E funded program that aim to use
  time-coincident power and load seeks to develop innovative management systems
  that represent the relative delivery risk of each asset and balance the
  collective risk of all assets across the grid. A risk-driven paradigm allows
  operators to: (i) fully understand the true likelihood of maintaining a
  supply-demand balance and system reliability, (ii) optimally manage the system,
  and (iii) assess the true value of essential reliability services. This
  paradigm shift is critical for all power systems and is essential for grids
  with high levels of stochastic resources. Projects will propose methods to
  quantify and manage risk at the asset level and at the system level.

  In support of the ARPA-E PERFORM project, NREL has produced a set of
  time-coincident load, wind, and solar generation profiles, including actual and
  forecasting time series. Both actuals and forecasts are provided in form of
  time-series with high temporal and spatial fidelity. Both deterministic and
  probabilistic forecasts are contained in the dataset.
