    Title: ARPA-E PERFORM

Description: 'The ARPA-E PERFORM Program is an ARPA-E funded program that aim to use

  time-coincident power and load seeks to develop innovative management systems

  that represent the relative delivery risk of each asset and balance the

  collective risk of all assets across the grid. A risk-driven paradigm allows

  operators to: (i) fully understand the true likelihood of maintaining a

  supply-demand balance and system reliability, (ii) optimally manage the system,

  and (iii) assess the true value of essential reliability services. This

  paradigm shift is critical for all power systems and is essential for grids

  with high levels of stochastic resources. Projects will propose methods to

  quantify and manage risk at the asset level and at the system level.


  In support of the ARPA-E PERFORM project, NREL has produced a set of

  time-coincident load, wind, and solar generation profiles, including actual and

  forecasting time series. Both actuals and forecasts are provided in form of

  time-series with high temporal and spatial fidelity. Both deterministic and

  probabilistic forecasts are contained in the dataset.
