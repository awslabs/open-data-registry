Name: USGS 3DEP LiDAR Point Clouds
Description: The goal of the [USGS 3D Elevation Program ](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep) (3DEP) is to collect elevation data in the form of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data over the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories, with data acquired over an 8-year period. This dataset provides two realizations of the 3DEP point cloud data. The first resource is a public access organization provided in [Entwine Point Tiles](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html) format, which a lossless, full-density, streamable octree based on [LASzip](https://laszip.org) (LAZ) encoding. The second resource is a [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) of the same data in LAZ (Compressed LAS) format. Resource names in both buckets correspond to the USGS project names.

Resources:
  - Description: Public access Entwine Point Tiles of most resources from the ``arn:aws:s3:::usgs-lidar`` bucket.
    ARN: arn:aws:s3:::usgs-lidar-public
    Region: us-west-2
    Type: S3 Bucket
  - Description: A [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) Bucket of Raw LAZ 1.4 3DEP data. Data in this bucket is more complete in coverage than the EPT bucket, but it is not a complete 3DEP mirror. Some resources in this bucket also have incomplete and missing coordinate system information, which is why they might not be mirrored into the EPT bucket.
