Name: USGS 3DEP LiDAR Point Clouds
Description: The goal of the [USGS 3D Elevation Program ](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep) (3DEP) is to collect elevation data in the form of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data over the conterminous United States, Hawaii, and the U.S. territories, with data acquired over an 8-year period. This dataset provides two realizations of the 3DEP point cloud data. The first resource is a public access organization provided in [Entwine Point Tiles](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html) format, which a lossless, full-density, streamable octree based on [LASzip](https://laszip.org) (LAZ) encoding. The second resource is a [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) of the original, Raw LAZ (Compressed LAS) 1.4 3DEP format, and more complete in coverage, as sources with incomplete or missing CRS, will not have an ETP tile generated.  Resource names in both buckets correspond to the USGS project names.

  - Description: A [Requester Pays](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RequesterPaysBuckets.html) Bucket of Raw LAZ 1.4 3DEP data. Data in this bucket is more complete in coverage than the EPT bucket, but it is not a complete 3DEP mirror. Some resources in this bucket also have incomplete and missing coordinate system information, which is why they might not be mirrored into the EPT bucket.
