Description: The Registry of Open Data on AWS contains publicly available datasets
  that are available for access from AWS resources. Note that datasets in this registry
  are available via AWS resources, but they are not provided by AWS; these datasets
  are owned and maintained by a variety of government organizations, researchers,
  businesses, and individuals. This dataset contains derived forms of the data in
  [https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry](https://github.com/awslabs/open-data-registry)
  that have been transformed for ease of use with machine interfaces. Currently, only
  the [ndjson](http://ndjson.org/) form of the registry is populated here.
